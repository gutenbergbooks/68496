<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sun was sinking towards the Borneo mountains.
The forest and the sea, inscrutable to the
bullying noon, relented in this discreeter light,
revealing secrets of green places. Birds began to
rustle in the big trees; the shaking of broad
leaves in the undergrowth betrayed the movement
of beasts of prey going about their daily work.
The stately innocence of Nature grew lovelier in
a sudden trouble of virginal consciousness.</p>

<p>There was only one sign of human habitation
in the landscape—a worn patch by the shore, like
a tiny wilderness in a vast oasis. Battered meat-tins,
empty bottles, and old newspapers littered
the waterline; under the rock was a tumble-down
hut and a shed; from a stable at the side a pony
looked out patiently over the half-door; something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
rustled in a big cage. In the twilight
under the shed a man lay sleeping in a low
hammock, grizzled and battered, with one bare
brown foot hanging over the edge. He yawned
and opened his eyes.</p>

<p>‘Are ye thar, Colonel?’</p>

<p>Another figure, which had been crouching
beside the hammock with a palm-leaf, watching
the sleeper, slowly uprose. Hardly a human figure
this, though dressed like a man; something rather
akin to the surrounding forest; a thing of large
majestic motions, and melancholy eyes, deep-set
under thick eyebrows. The man sat up and
coughed for a little while.</p>

<p>‘Whar’s the dinner, Colonel? You’ve not lit
the fire yet.’</p>

<p>‘Fire crackles,’ said the Colonel.</p>

<p>The man stretched and spat.</p>

<p>‘Ah, you was afraid the noise’d wake me,
sonny. Wahl, hurry up now, for I’m as peckish
as a pea-hen.’</p>

<p>The man refilled his pipe from the big tin
that lay in the hammock with him, while the
Colonel, going hither and thither with large, deft<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
movements, piled a fire, boiled a pot and spread
the dinner. Dinner ready, he brought it to the
man; crouching at his feet he watched him reverently
as he handled knife and fork. At the smell
of dinner a number of large monkeys came swinging
down from the trees and collected outside the
shed. A captive chimpanzee came out of a tub-kennel
and began to ramble swiftly and silently
to and fro on its chain, as if developing in movement
some unwholesome purpose conceived in the
hours of quiescence. The man threw them pieces
from time to time, for which they scrambled and
fought in a way that called for interference.</p>

<p>‘Now, Chauncey, you leave pore Amélie’s
whiskers alone. That piece was meant for her....
Go slow, Marie! and you, William J. Bryan,
get up off Talmage, unless you’ve a yearn for the
far-end of my teacher’s help.’</p>

<p>When the meal was over the American took
out some sewing—some old clothes of his own,
that he was patching up for the Colonel—while
the Colonel ate the scraps that remained, and
cleared the things away. This done, the Colonel
came and sat down once more by the man.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>‘Whar’s your Word-makin’ and Word-takin’
gotten to, Colonel?’ said the American, looking
up from his sewing. ‘Hev you bin hidin’ it up
that teak tree agen?’</p>

<p>The Colonel looked uncomfortably about him,
blinked once or twice, and scratched his thigh.</p>

<p>‘Burn my fingers,’ said the man, ‘but I think
you’re as like a human b’y as any ape can get.
Slip off yer boots. Mosey up and fetch ’em back
right now, you young hellion, and spell me out
“Home, sweet home,” afore I get to the end of
this seam.’</p>

<p>‘So I’m a scientific discoverer, am I?’ mused
the American, left alone. ‘And I’ve foun’ the
Missin’ Link at last, hev I? There’ll be a pile
o’ money in that, I shouldn’t wonder. The
Colonel’ll be mighty pleased when he hears he
ain’t an or’nary ape; he’ll be as proud as a Bishop
among the angels.’</p>

<p>The Colonel meanwhile came climbing with
swift and solemn accuracy down the teak tree,
the box of letters in his mouth. The chimpanzee
growled and chattered with aimless fury as she
roamed to and fro.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>‘See here, Colonel, I’ve hed a letter from the
Boss. I fotch it in along with that passel on last
Toosday.... Squit that I-talian music, you
dun-coloured Dago’—this to the chimpanzee—‘you
unlicensed traveller in otto o’ roses; shet
yer head, I say, and don’t show yer lunch-hooks
at me.... I’ll hev to get rid o’ that dosh-burned
critter; she’ll niver be a credit to the
Show.... Whar was I? Why, letter from the
Boss; that’s so. Wahl, thar was noos in that
letter fur you an’ me, Colonel, big noos.’</p>

<p>The Colonel turned his melancholy eyes on
his master: their expression never varied, but
his breath came quick and fast with an unspoken
interrogation.</p>

<p>‘I’d bin expeckin’ it fur a lawng time; but I
begin to feel sorter queer now it’s nigh on comin’
true.’</p>

<p>‘Are they goin’ to fetch us away?’ said the
Colonel.</p>

<p>‘This vurry next day that is, Colonel; one of
his boats will put in here and fetch me away with
the whole of my bag o’ tricks to meet the Show
in London.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>‘You’re mighty glad, eh?’</p>

<p>‘I’m that, sonny. But I feel sorter queer too.
I’ve grown kinder used to this life, bein’ boss
myself an’ all that. And yet, if you come to
think of it, ... by Jelly, it’s the queerest thing
of all. Me goin’ inter pardnership, as you might
say, with an ornary ape! Hand me the matches,
sonny—by my foot thar; this blamey pipe’s gone
out agen.... Here was I an’ pore old Jabez
dumped down by the Boss, to train some monkeys
for his show. Whin Jabez took the fever and
went over the range I began to be kinder lonesome;
got a sorter hungry feel in my teeth with
not speakin’. So I slipped into a kinder habit
o’ talkin’ to you all like humans, jest to ease my
gums. An’ all of a sudden, one fine day, Colonel,
you bein’ dissatisfied with yer dinner, you ups
an’ answers me back. I was tolerable astonished
at the time, I remember, tho’ I didn’t let on,
maybe, but jest caught you a clip on the ear for
sassin’ yer biggers, an’ passed along. I’d niver
hed any back-talk from an anthropoid before.
Of course, as you say, it came nateral-like to you;
you was on’y addin’ one more language to your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
vurry considerable stock, an’ I reckon from what
you tell me that the de-flections of the verb are
much simpler in Amurrkan than in Chimpanzee
for instance; but the fack remains that you’re
the first monkey I iver heard talkin’ outside of
his own dialeck. The Boss was considerable
interessted in my re-port, an’ he’s worked up a
theory of how your species got the bulge on the
rest by larnin’ their various lingoes, workin’ trade
relations, and pouchin’ the difference of exchange
on cokernuts an’ bread-fruits. It’s his idee to
deliver himself of a lecture on the subject before
the R’yal Institoot, an’ make you sing some o’
your folksongs whin we get to London.’</p>

<p>‘Ah—what like’s London, dad?’</p>

<p>‘Wahl, sonny, it’s not so fine a place as
Bawston, but it has its p’ints. The people are
easier took in than in Bawston, an’ we find it a
better place for a Show. Then they hev a King
in London, which we don’t hev in Bawston;
besides dooks and markises, which we on’y see in
Amurrka in the pairin’ season. An’ Shakspere
was born near there too, an’ the original Miss
Corelli. One city’s much like another, whin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
you’ve bin three years in Borneo. What a man
gits a yearn for is civalisation.’</p>

<p>‘Ci-va-li-sation ... What’s civalisation,
dad?’</p>

<p>‘It’s a hard word, sonny; but it means purty
well everything we don’t hev here in Borneo. It
means leadin’ a higher life, hustlin’ around,
machinery, perlicemen, hevin’ a good time, iced
drinks, theaters, ringin’ a bell fer yer boots, an’
a hunderd other things. Gas lamps, an’ electric
light, an’ beer, an’ wine——’</p>

<p>‘Like yonder?’</p>

<p>‘That’s it, sonny; like that lot I brought
from Bilimano, on’y stronger. An’ iverybody’s
in lovely close; all the women lookin’ like
picters outer “Puck”; all the men wi’ creases
down their pants; pavement down along all the
streets——’</p>

<p>‘Don’t stop sewin’, dad.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, you young scamp, you’re eager to git
inter yer new pair, I can see. Gosh, but the
women, they’re hunky.’</p>

<p>‘What like’s the streets, dad?’</p>

<p>‘It’s a cur’ous thing, but you don’t seem to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
take so much interest in the women as I’d hev
expected, sonny ... I reckon you were in the
habit, before I caught you, of sorter climbin’ out
with gals of your own species among the banyan-trees
down away in Java; and you don’t set
much store by other kinds. That’ll be another
p’int for the lecture.... Think what a man I’ll
be over in England, sonny; I’ll be top o’ the tree
over thar, you’ll be proud to know me. I’ll be
flyin’ around the town in a plug hat an’ silver-topped
cane, noddin’ an’ affable howdy to my
multitudinous friends from the top of a tramcar.
“Who’s that?” people will say. “Why, don’t
you know? That’s the scientific man who foun’
the Missin’ Link.”’</p>

<p>‘Missin’ ... Missin’ what, dad?’</p>

<p>‘The Missin’ Link.’</p>

<p>‘What’s the ... Missin’ Link?’</p>

<p>‘Wahl, I should smile! Ef I hedn’t clean
forgotten to tell you. It’s all in the Boss’s
letter. Why—you’re the Missin’ Link, sonny!’</p>

<p>‘What’s that, anyway?’</p>

<p>‘Wahl, sonny, it means a sort o’ monkey that
isn’t quite an ornary sort o’ monkey ... kinder,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
sorter.... Wahl, as you might say, sonny,
partly almost more like a man.’</p>

<p>‘Like—like you, dad?’</p>

<p>‘Wahl, not that exactly—a sorter lower
creation altogether. But there’s a lot o’ scientific
folks as says that men are descended from Missin’
Links.’</p>

<p>The Colonel rose to his feet and looked out to
sea with dilated nostrils.</p>

<p>‘Missin’ Links ... men ... civalisation
... and Colonel’s a Missin’ Link! Why, then....’</p>

<p>‘Go slow, sonny. I on’y said you was a peg
higher’n an omary monkey. Jest sit down quiet
an’ figure out “anthropoid” with those letters o’
yourn. You’d be mighty small potatoes in a
civalised crowd; so you’ve no need to slop over
that way.’</p>

<p>The Colonel sat down, obediently, to his
letters, and they both worked in silence for some
time.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ continued the American, ‘I shouldn’t
wonder ef they was to eleck me a member of some
of those larned societies of theirs. They’ll be
askin’ me out to champagne dinners, too, no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
doubt. I shouldn’t wonder now ef I was to be
asked to go an’ dine with the Prince of Wales—him
I was tellin’ you about; distinguished
furriners always go to dine with the Prince o’
Wales.’</p>

<p>‘Take Colonel too, dad?’</p>

<p>‘Whar to, sonny?’</p>

<p>‘The Prince o’ Wales’s.’</p>

<p>‘Now that’s downright foolish to be talkin’ like
that, Colonel. You’ll hev to stay with the Show,
of course.... You’ll be pleased with the Show;
it’s the most fre-quented place in London; they’ll
be givin’ you buns an’ candy all day long. The
Boss was thinkin’ of puttin’ you in the anamal
department, but ef he’s pleased with you I
shouldn’t wonder but what he’d promote you to
the human monstrosities. I’ll put in a good
word for you. We’ve bin the best o’ friends,
Colonel; you kin hev the key o’ my trunk any
day; but I won’t be able to see so much of you
arter to-morrow. No. I’ve been thinkin’ over
the question keerfully, an’ I’ve concluded you an’
me’ll not be able to travel over together.’</p>

<p>The Colonel listened with impassive attention.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
The American avoided his eye with some little
embarrassment.</p>

<p>‘There’s all manner o’ difficulties, sonny. In
the first place, these ignorant Christian sailor-lads
that’ll come ashore to-morrow won’t perhaps
hardly grasp the situation ef they find me talkin’
ornary sense with a hairy pagan ape; an’ I think
you’d best keep yer head shet until they’ve gotten
used to the looks of you, an’ I’ve hed time to
explain matters. It might create some jealousies
in the crew ef you was set up over their heads to
consort with the captain an’ the mate, as I’ll be
doin’. At first sight it seemed to me as ef you’d
hev to travel all alone in the steerage as a third-class
passenger.’</p>

<p>‘Steerage—what’s the steerage?’</p>

<p>‘That’s down in the between decks. Not so
bad, sonny: I’ve travelled that way often myself.
But it’s not high-class, like travellin’ with the
captain.... Yes, that’s what I’d meant at first.
But there’s obstacles in the way o’ that too,
sonny. I’ve been thinkin’ ef we enter you as a
passenger there may be difficulties at the Custom
House with the Alien Immigrants Act. They’re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
mighty pertikler.... There, that’s done!’ he
interjected, as he bit off the thread and held up
the new trousers to view. ‘Climb inter those
pants, sonny, an’ let’s see how they look.’</p>

<p>The Colonel did as he was told, and the
American continued:</p>

<p>‘You an’ me would be mightily put about to
fill in the form of declaration as to famaly history
an’ religion an’ what not, ef it’s the same as in
the States. An’ on the whole I’ve concluded it
will be best to put you back in your old hutch
and take you over under the Large Wild Anamals
Act.’</p>

<p>The Colonel seemed wholly absorbed in the
adjustment of his clothes. The muscles of his
big jaw worked backwards and forwards to a
pressure of the teeth.</p>

<p>‘They’re a bit baggy behind,’ continued his
patron. ‘I’ll hev to take a reef in the seat. Slip
’em off again; you won’t be needin’ any close any
more till we get over to London.’</p>

<p>Instead of obeying, the Colonel walked slowly
forward out of the penthouse to the shade of a
young tree where a big wooden cage lay lumbering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
on its side. He looked at it and turned it thoughtfully
over with a push of his powerful leg; then
laid one hand on the thick bough above him, the
other on the stem of the tree. A slow cracking
and rustling ensued, splinters gaped white, the
bough was in his hands, raised aloft, and descending
furiously, smashing the old hutch to little pieces.
The American rose astounded from his hammock.</p>

<p>‘Quit that foolin’, and come here!’</p>

<p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

<p>‘Come here, you mule-headed monkey.’</p>

<p>The Colonel dropped breathless for one
moment on all fours, rose to his full height
swinging the monstrous branch over his head and
sending forth a long loud yell like a man in a
nightmare, then swept crashing away into the
forest, his weapon thumping like a sledge-hammer
as he went.</p>

<p>The monkeys in the trees about chattered
applause or commentary, a cloud of sea-fowl flew
up from the shore, and the American stood
scratching the back of his head thoughtfully in
the midst. Then he looked round at the trees
and the sea and the pony, taking them all into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
his confidence with a discomfited smile; pulled
himself together and shouted:</p>

<p>‘Colonel!’</p>

<p>He grew contemptuous at the want of an
answer, thrust down the ashes in his pipe with a
horny finger, and returned slowly to his rest under
the shed, consoling his solitude with a slow-flowing
murmur of scorn:</p>

<p>‘All right, my child. You wait till you come
back. Civalisation! You! You ornary, popeyed,
bobtailed, jimber-jawed, jerrybuilt jackass....’</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">II</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Colonel went through the virgin forest,
spending his fury in motion, swinging forward
from branch to branch, running, leaping, till the
fury was lost in the recovered delight of liberty.
Childhood continued, after an irrelevance.</p>

<p>Here was the old smell of forest earth, the
inexhaustible plenty of bare elastic boughs, the
cool feeling of fungus, the absence of articulate
speech, the impossibility of anger. Night came,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
the grand and terrible night, with its old familiar
fear, long lost in the neighbourhood of a confident
human mind. He rejoiced in his fear as in a fine
quality recovered, rousing it to an ecstasy after
long silences, by murmuring his own name in the
darkness in terrified tones: ‘Colonel! Colonel!’</p>

<p>Then there came a rustling of leaves, a low
chuck-chuck of prey warning prey, the sound of a
vast retreat, and the slow padding of panther feet
on the forest floor. The Colonel lay still on
his bough, tingling with an unnatural calm, and
the Panther breathed deep below him and looked
up. And the Panther said:</p>

<p>‘I am <i>the</i> Panther, all Panthers in one—a
symbol, irresistible.’</p>

<p>Waves of strong life undulated down his
spotted tail, as though life passed through him
to and from all his tribe; and the Colonel lay in
a pleasant fear and numbness on his bough. And
the Panther said:</p>

<p>‘I will climb slowly to you.’</p>

<p>‘And leap suddenly!’</p>

<p>‘The glory of my eye shall increase upon
you.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>‘Numbing my limbs!’</p>

<p>‘We will fall and play together on the earth.’</p>

<p>‘I shall die!’</p>

<p>‘A noble death.’</p>

<p>‘I shall be torn and eaten!’</p>

<p>‘And your strength shall go into the strength
of All the Panthers.’</p>

<p>But as the Panther reached the fork of the
boughs his paw slipped, and the numbness left
the Colonel, and he leaped upon the neck of the
panther with fingers and teeth, crying:</p>

<p>‘You are not All the Panthers, but a single
creature like myself; and I will tear you as I
tear a young tree when my limbs desire it.’</p>

<p>They fell together, a long distance, to the
earth, and the Colonel grasped one mauling hind-paw
of the panther with one foot and gripped
him by the belly with the other, and rolled over
and over with him, and strangled him, and tore
his two jaws apart to the shoulder as an angry
man might tear a glove. Then he licked his
wounds and slung his boots over his shoulder
again, and forgot all about the battle but the
joy of unlimited ferocity.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>So he went forward from day to day, forgetful
of the past, and thoughtless for the future, till
he came to the top of the mountain, and, looking
back, beheld the sea. He gazed at it for some
time, then murmured ‘Civalisation!’ and fell
into a deep gloom of thought.</p>

<p>He followed the tops of the mountains to
the north, with an obscure dissatisfaction growing
in the dark back places of his mind; the pleasure
of motion was poisoned in each extreme tension
by a recurrent languor. He lacked something,
and he did not know what he lacked. He went
idly forward for many days, till he heard the
chopping of an axe. He drew stealthily nearer
to the sound, and followed the man back in the
evening to his village—a village of naked men
with dark skins, very orderly and quiet. And
the Colonel lurked about by the village and
watched the people, and was happy again.</p>

<p>For he had tasted the supreme happiness of
the animal, the nearness of Man. The animal
that has once had Man for his companion or for
his prey is never afterwards contented with other
company or fare. Curiosity had taken its place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
among his appetites; the necessity of watching
Man’s inscrutable ways, the pleasure of using his
implements and reproducing his effects.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">III</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the dead of night the Colonel descended into
the midst of the village, in boots and torn
trousers, and drew water on the long beam-lever
from the well and poured it into the tank,
talking gently to himself while he did it; and
the villagers, awakened by the creaking and
rattling, crept to crannies and looked on and
trembled.</p>

<p>And in the morning they gathered in the
village square and speculated. Who is he? The
women were afraid to go into the forest; the ripe
crops dropped the seed from their ears in the
clearings.</p>

<p>Night after night he was there, and graciously
tasted of their offerings of fruit and cakes. No
one slept by night but the children, and the
priest who dreamed true dreams. The priest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
was their hope, for through him alone could the
Soochings learn from the gods what must be
believed and done. And day after day the
perplexity grew, for the priest was old and forgot
his dreams; and though he sat till sunset with
the doctors of the law about him, he could not
recall them.</p>

<p>But, one day, when they had sat for many
hours in silence, watching the True Dreamer with
his head bowed between his knees, trying to
remember, a young priest spoke:</p>

<p>‘I myself have had a dream.’</p>

<p>‘Of what use are your dreams?’ said the old
man, looking quickly up.</p>

<p>‘I dreamed that I saw the True Dreamer
sleeping; and over him stood the vision of a
dead man, with the burial cords hanging loose
about him, and a peeled rod in his hand as of a
messenger.’</p>

<p>A murmur ran round the squatting circle.</p>

<p>‘It is true,’ said the old man ‘I have seen
this vision three times.’</p>

<p>‘And the True Dreamer said, “Who is he
that cometh by night?” And the vision answered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
“It is the God with Two Names, the inventor
of the blow-pipe, come back to be king over the
tribe as in the first time.”’</p>

<p>‘Katongo tells the truth,’ said the old man
‘so spake the vision.’</p>

<p>‘And the True Dreamer said, “Who shall be
his chief priest and interpret his meaning to the
multitude?” And the vision answered, “You
yourself, O True Dreamer; and at your right
hand shall stand the young man Katongo, who is
foolish, but full of zeal.”’</p>

<p>‘All this was so,’ said the old man. ‘And,
furthermore, the messenger told me the rites by
which the God with Two Names may be propitiated.
These rites are a secret which it is
unlawful to reveal till the time be come. But
should any of them be left undone, pestilence and
destruction will fall on the whole tribe.’</p>

<p>The True Dreamer arose and went back to
his house. The news spread through the tribe,
and there was great rejoicing. The old king
was promptly clubbed on the head, and the
priests, attended by the state conch-blowers and
heralds, proclaimed the accession of the new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
monarch under the title of King Dwala, Him-of-Two-Names,
both unknown; drums were beaten,
hogs were killed, and the tribe gave itself up to
frenzies of loyalty and large draughts of the
fermented juice of the mowa-tree.</p>

<p>The Colonel, terrified by the noise, withdrew
further into the forest, and did not dare to
return for several days. His absence gave no
one but the priests the least concern, as his place
was efficiently filled by a painted image of ugly
and imposing aspect.</p>

<p>Preparations were hurried on for solemnising
the nuptials of the new monarch—or the image—at
the new moon, to the sacred sago-tree which
stood in the middle of the place of assembly.</p>

<p>Politically speaking, the result of all these
events was that the war party had captured
the machine. The question which divided the
Soochings at this time was the relation to be
adopted by the tribe towards the gold-diggers
who had lately penetrated into the Sooching
forest. Many members of the tribe looked upon
the miners as harmless idiots, bound by the curse
of some more powerful magician to sweat at a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
spade, and too stupid to guard their treasures of
wonderful mugs and tins and nails and even large
pieces of corrugated iron from the clumsiest of
thieves; but the seriously-minded tribesmen, and
especially the religious party, penetrated their
hidden motive of digging up the Spirit of Tree-Vigour,
and bringing upon the Sooching forest
that same blight of sterility which followed the
track of the white men wherever they went.
Nothing, in their view, could appease the already
irritated Spirit but the wholesale destruction of
these desecrators.</p>

<p>The Colonel’s continued absence put the war
party in a dangerous position; the more so as a
Jew from the mining camp arrived at this time
with a little cartload of looking-glasses and whisky
in the village, and brought over a number of
wobblers to the party of peace. The True
Dreamer worked hard for his party, dreaming
judicious dreams by night, and organising search
parties in the daytime for the purpose of bringing
the new king to his throne.</p>

<p>The Colonel watched the search parties with
interest, and at last had the courage to follow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
one of them back to the edge of the camp.
That night, as he was amusing himself by the
well in the moonlight, he was astonished at hearing
a low clear whistle, and seeing men approaching
him slowly from every side with deep obeisances;
he had never yet seen human beings in this
attitude, which seemed to be copied from the
other animals. But it appeared that they meant
kindly by it, and he let them approach until they
made a small circle about him. A gaunt old
man stood before him with arms upraised to the
sky, pouring forth a torrent of incomprehensible
words. Not knowing what was expected of him,
the Colonel took a mug that lay beside him,
dipped it in the tank, and handed it to the
old man, whose eyes gushed over with tears of
delight at this sign of favour; while the rest
made a clucking noise with their tongues and
said:</p>

<p>‘Dwala malana!’—which means, ‘Glory to
Him-of-Two-Names.’</p>

<p>They invited him with gestures to taste the
dishes of fruit which lay about him; and he did
so, to their great joy. The village had all turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
out by now; torches flared and smoked on every
side; and it was in a blaze of light and through
a thick avenue of men, women and children that
the Colonel was at last conducted to the temple
which had been prepared for him. The noise of
conchs and drums had no more terrors for him
now, and he watched the dances with an intensity
of interest that threw him at last into a state of
hypnotic coma.</p>

<p>The village slept late next morning. When
the Colonel awoke he went out, from force of
habit, to prepare breakfast. The guardians who
slept on the threshold sat up and watched his
movements awhile in stupid amazement; his quiet
exit by the window had failed at first to rouse
them.</p>

<p>He was working impatiently and irritably:
he was afraid of being late; nothing was in its
place. There was no axe to chop the wood; he
had to break it with his hands. There were no
matches, no tins of beef. It took all the gestures
of all the priests to make him understand that he
must not work. In time he grew used to being
waited on by others; he grew used to obeisances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
and reverence. It was a new interest, and not
more puzzling than most things. One thing disturbed
him. Outside the temple was posted the
Royal Minstrel, who played only one tune on his
pipe—the Royal Tune. At first the Colonel had
been delighted with this tune, and had made the
minstrel play it to him from morning till night.
But he grew tired of it. Whenever he opened
the door, or even so much as showed his head at
a window, the minstrel fired off this thing; when
he went outside the village on any errand the
minstrel followed him playing it. It maddened
him, and at last he broke the pipe over the
minstrel’s head and slunk back into his temple,
and was very miserable for the rest of the day.
But the people were delighted with this kingly trait,
and the minstrel sold the pieces for a large price.</p>

<p>A strict watch was kept over his movements
at first for fear he should escape; but after a
while this was relaxed, and he used to roam at
will in the forest. He usually returned at night,
but not always. He visited the gold-diggings,
but was alarmed by the look of the diggers, who
reminded him of the American; he was afraid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
they would put him into a hutch. In another
part of the forest he found a white man with
a large family. The women and children were
greatly frightened; but the man invited him into
the house and told him he was a Missionary. The
Colonel stayed there two days, and was converted
to Christianity.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the tribe was preparing for war.
The women were sealed up hermetically in huts;
the warriors danced and rubbed their muscles with
mowa juice; and late one night they disappeared
silently with shields and spears among the trees.
Next day they appeared again, exultant, with
loads of booty; the white men had been utterly
routed.</p>

<p>The stupefaction of the succeeding orgies
was partially dispelled after many days by the
frenzy of inspired minstrels, who proclaimed the
imminence of the second Golden Age, and the permanent
establishment of the wise and beneficent
empire of the great Prince Dwala, Him-of-Two-Names,
over the whole of the island, and those
eyots beyond which constituted the rest of the
habitable world.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>The power of actual motion was finally
restored by the rattle of musketry in the grey
light of one dawn, and the snapping of twigs
overhead, followed by the appearance of men in
khaki among the trees. Unarmed and unprepared,
the villagers fled into the forest beyond,
and not a soul remained but the old Dreamer,
who was seeking new visions in the quiet recesses
of his sleeping apartment, and the Colonel, who
ensconced himself comfortably in the sago-tree
to watch this new human phenomenon. Horses
crouched and snorted, dragging guns up the last
slope, with a cluster of men straining at each
wheel; infantrymen advanced and halted and
turned at a shouted word; and the Colonel sat
and looked on as at a new dance performed for his
amusement. He was delighted at the burning of
the huts, which made the biggest flame he had
ever seen; but he grew tired at last of the long
pauses in the ballet; so he climbed down to the
tank and splashed water over the officers.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> royal prisoner was royally housed. After
the jolting journey in the sultry covered wagon,
to the steady tramp of the marching soldiers, and
the frightened crying of the old Dreamer who
crouched beside him, it was pleasant to be in
these spacious rooms, to look from under the sun-blinds
into the leafy garden, to sit on the wet
stones and dabble in the black pool in the hall.</p>

<p>Prince Dwala was shut up in the Old Residence
while the Colonial Office made up its mind what
was to be done with him. Compassionate ladies
sent him baskets full of flowers. The rest of the
prisoners—the Dreamer and a rabble of braves
hunted down in the hills—were huddled away in
the jail.</p>

<p>The Prince had many visitors. The Governor
came, accompanied by his staff, young men in
cocked hats, who looked as tall and morose as
possible while the Governor lectured him. A
young man came from the ‘Pioneer’ and interviewed
him as to his opinion of Western civilisation;
the Prince’s answers were disjointed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
amounting to little more than ejaculations, such
as ‘iced drinks’ and ‘theaters’; but his interest
was evident, and the ‘Pioneer’ said that his
views on the subject were ‘quite equal to those of
some of the best of our Indian Princes.’ On the
all-engrossing gold question he had been diplomatically
discreet, nor would he commit himself
on the equally difficult question of the British
suzerainty over the Soochings.</p>

<p>He had numerous visits from Mr. Wyndham
Cato, the Pro-Boer M.P., who was staying with
the Governor, having arrived in the course of a
grand tour of the Colonies, destined to supply
him with ammunition for an attack on the
Government all along the line on the ‘native
question.’ But for Mr. Cato, the case of the
Soochings would never have attained the importance
it had. The Governor was disposed to
treat the whole thing as a hole-and-corner brawl,
a question of police; he would have bundled
Dwala and his braves obscurely away into a penal
settlement if he had been left alone. Mr. Cato
blew the bubble. Bouverie Street and Whitehall,
stimulated by telegrams, reacted one on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
other. It became a public matter. The Governor
smiled benignly, and squared it up to a larger
scale. Thanks to Mr. Cato, Prince Dwala was a
captive Prince instead of an arrested malefactor.
The Prince conceived a warm affection for the
little man, who let him try on his gold spectacles,
and showed him how his watch wound up.</p>

<p>‘I have very little influence with the Governor;
I have done all I can, and I am afraid that your
deposition is certain,’ said Mr. Cato, one day, as
he and the Prince squatted side by side at the
edge of the pool—Mr. Cato folding little paper
boats out of pieces of newspaper, while the Prince
stirred the water with his foot to make them bob
up and down. ‘But, even then, you will still be a
Prince, and it is better to be a native Prince than
the hereditary tyrant of a so-called civilised
country, the heir of one of our mushroom dynasties
of Europe, whose only purpose in life is to help
a self-elected aristocracy, as vulgar as themselves,
to grind down the sweating millions of honest
working folk. You will still receive your revenues,
if there is any justice left in this disjointed world
of ours. I shall agitate to the best of my power<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
to get some addition to your income from our
niggardly Government. You will be a comparatively
rich man, and if you win your lawsuit
you ought to do very well indeed. Nobody has
a right to prevent your going to London if you
wish to. I am starting myself in a few days, and
if you will allow me, I shall be very glad to take
you with me.’</p>

<p>‘Not in a hutch?’</p>

<p>‘A “hutch”? Don’t be absurd. You won’t
be a prisoner. You’ll travel as I travel. And,
until some suitable residence has been found for
you, I insist on your coming to stay with us at
Hampstead. I am sure that my aunt and the
two sisters who live with me will welcome you
most warmly.’</p>

<p>The lawsuit to which Mr. Cato alluded was
one of his own contriving. When the first load
of gold from the mines was sold to the Bank, the
Solicitor-General for the Colony had put in a
claim for a royalty, which was met by the defence
that the mine was outside the limits of the colony.
The miners set up concessions granted by the
deceased monarch of the Soochings. Mr. Cato, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
republican at home, but a firm upholder of the
divine rights of ‘native’ princes, hired a lawyer
on behalf of Prince Dwala and claimed the mines
as his personal property, set aside from time
immemorial for the maintenance of the dignity
of the Royal House. The tribe at large had
never exercised more than the right of hunting
over them. He denied the validity of the concessions,
and asked for a declaration that the fee
simple was vested in the Prince.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">V</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Prince Dwala</span> formed a frequent subject of conversation
at the Residence. Mr. Cato disagreed
on every possible question with everybody there;
but they found him a charming visitor, and the
process of ‘draain’ his leg,’ as the Scotch call
it, was an unfailing amusement to the younger
members of the party.</p>

<p>He found them assembled round the breakfast
table when he came out on the veranda
next morning, beaming round through his gold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
spectacles with that benevolent smile with which
he always began the day. Lady Crampton sat at
the end, behind a silver urn—a flighty, good-looking
creature, who might have passed for
thirty. Besides her there were Mademoiselle and
the three girls; Dick Crampton, and Reggie the
nephew—secretaries both—deep in the batch
of last month’s newspapers, which had just
arrived.</p>

<p>The Governor and his private secretary were
still at work.</p>

<p>‘When’s the execution, Dick?’ said Reggie,
helping himself to ham.</p>

<p>‘Half-past ten, old man; you’ve lots of time.’</p>

<p>‘The usual tortures, I suppose?’</p>

<p>‘Just the usual. The Mater’s been up for
hours sharpenin’ the spikes of the rack.’</p>

<p>‘Getting rusty, I suppose?’</p>

<p>‘Not they! They got blunted over all those
land-tax defaulters last week.’</p>

<p>Helen, the youngest girl, tossed her long hair
over her cheeks and exploded with laughter.</p>

<p>‘Soyez gentille, Hélène,’ said Mademoiselle:
‘les jeunes filles bien élevées ne rient pas à table.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>Mr. Cato adjusted his spectacles, and stared
with horror from face to face.</p>

<p>‘What nonsense are those boys talkin’ down
there?’ said Lady Crampton. ‘For Heaven’s
sake don’t choke, Helen! Dick, you naughty
boy, do try to behave.’</p>

<p>‘You mind what the Mater says, Reggie.’</p>

<p>‘What was Her Excellency pleased to remark?’</p>

<p>‘She says you’re not to play the elephas mas
gigas ass. Hello, Guv’; good mornin’.’</p>

<p>His Excellency came in, tall and débonnaire,
and sat down to breakfast. After him came
his private secretary, a pale and anxious young
man, who said little, and opened an egg as
if he expected to find an important despatch
inside it.</p>

<p>‘Any news, Reggie?’ said the Governor,
cheerfully rubbing his large white hands together.</p>

<p>‘Fry’s hurt his finger.’</p>

<p>‘Bad luck to it!’</p>

<p>‘Well, Sir Henry,’ said Mr. Cato, beaming
away, ‘I’m going to have a <i>good talk</i> with you
after breakfast about Prince Dwala.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>‘Too busy, too busy, my dear Sir. You talk
it over with Mr. Batts; <i>he</i> knows all about
everything.’</p>

<p>The private secretary looked up darkly, and
gave a dry nod at Mr. Cato.</p>

<p>‘Rum chap that Prince,’ said Reggie: ‘looks
uncommon like a monkey.’</p>

<p>Mr. Cato flushed with indignation.</p>

<p>‘<i>Please</i> don’t talk like that, Mr. Crampton. I
know you mean no harm; but it’s just by little
remarks like that that we Englishmen nourish that
narrow-minded contempt for natives to which we
are all of us only too prone.’</p>

<p>‘Dear little things, monkeys,’ murmured the
tactful Lady Crampton: ‘my sister used to keep
one in Kensington, till it took to hidin’ food in
the beds, and had to be given to the Zoo.’</p>

<p>After breakfast Mr. Cato and Mr. Batts
retired into a dark chamber, and discussed the
question of the Prince’s future. Mr. Batts sat
like an eminent specialist, with folded arms and
pursed lips, while Mr. Cato expounded his views.
Mr. Batts held out great hopes of the Government
coming down handsomely.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>‘My dear Sir, we couldn’t have chosen a
better moment for the application. The Colonial
Office is bound to spend its grant by the end of
the financial year, under penalty of having it
reduced in the next Budget—it’s a Treasury rule.
What I’m telling you is a secret, mind; don’t let
it go any further. Between you and me, my
dear Sir, they’re often glad if some expense of
this kind turns up to put their surplus into; and
once they’ve got him over, it’s easy enough to
get the item renewed year by year. They like
native potentates; it’s picturesque and popular.
As for preventing white men from going into
their country, that is a policy which I can’t
accept. It’s opposed to the natives’ own interest:
their countries could never be developed without
European assistance.’</p>

<p>‘How do you mean “developed,” Mr. Batts?’</p>

<p>‘Well, take the question of gold, for instance.
These lazy beggars the Soochings would simply
leave it lying useless in the ground, as far as they
are concerned. Mind you, I’m not saying that
all these Jews and foreigners who start the thing
are the most desirable people to carry civilisation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
among the savages. Providence works for good
by very funny means.’</p>

<p>‘But the gold belongs to the Soochings.’</p>

<p>‘Gold or any other commodity belongs by
the law of nature to the man who works it. It’s
a reward for his industry. That’s in Mill. It’s
not by any means such an easy thing working a
mine as you might think, especially in a savage
country. First of all, there’s the labour difficulty
to deal with.’</p>

<p>‘What do you mean by the “labour difficulty”?’</p>

<p>‘Getting labour, of course; native labour to
work the mine.’</p>

<p>‘But what are the Europeans doing there, if
they’re not going to labour?’</p>

<p>‘You’ve evidently not studied the mining
question, my dear Sir. Once the prospecting is
over, Europeans don’t <i>dig</i>. That would be very
primitive. They have their work pretty well cut
out as it is, pegging out their claims and looking
after the men to see they don’t steal. Of course
they have to get natives to dig for them—Soochings
in this case.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>‘But why should the Soochings dig for
them?’</p>

<p>‘Why should they, my dear Sir? Why,
we’d pretty soon <i>make</i> ’em! But it’s no good
arguing these big questions on first principles.
We simply follow the policy which has worked
so well in other parts of the world.... Now
what’s your figure for the Prince’s salary from the
Colonial Office?’</p>

<p>‘Well, what do you say to a thousand a
year?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, make it two, make it two. That
Mandingo man gets two thousand; and we don’t
want to have our native princes priced lower
than Africans. It’s just these things which fix
the status of a Colony in the eyes of London
people.’</p>

<p>‘Good; two thousand.’</p>

<p>‘And as big a lump down as we can screw
out of them. I’ll instruct His Excellency.’</p>

<p>‘Then he’ll get his ordinary revenue from his
subjects?’</p>

<p>‘That won’t amount to much.’</p>

<p>‘And the royalties on the gold?’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>‘Don’t count on that. I saw the Chief
Justice last night; he’s going to give it against
you.’</p>

<p>‘I shall appeal.’</p>

<p>‘To the Privy Council? Well, well: one
never knows what will happen when a case gets
to the Privy Council.’</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">VI</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Cato</span> found his path unexpectedly smooth.
The Colonial Secretary, delighted at shifting an
awkward responsibility on to the shoulders of a
political opponent, telegraphed a gracious acceptance
of Mr. Cato’s offer to take charge of the
Prince. The two thousand a year was promised
without bargaining, with another two thousand
down for initial expenses. The Colonial Court, it
is true, had decided against the Sooching claim,
but leave was given to appeal; and Mr. Cato
took a lawyer and a packing-case full of evidence
with him on board the P. &amp; O. in order to carry
the question before the Privy Council.</p>

<p>He had taken up the clubs for Prince<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
Dwala on purely unselfish grounds, but he could
not help feeling a personal satisfaction in the
results of what he had done. His whole tour
had been a success; now that he had seen the
various kinds of native whom he had so long
championed in Parliament, the rightness of his
attitude came home to him with a picturesque
forcibleness. He was like a dramatist who had
seen all his plays acted one after the other for
the first time. And now by this last lucky hit
he had put himself over the heads of all his
rivals in his own peculiar line of politics. Prince
Dwala’s case would be famous; his colleagues
would help him trounce the Government for this
wicked gold war; the credit of it would be his;
every question would come round to him for
a final answer; the oppressed native would be
sitting at home in his drawing-room. As he lay
awake in his bunk he caught himself musing
pleasurably over the social distinction which it
might involve. Nonsense! A Prince is no better
than any other man, or very little. Still, other
people think so; it would be amusing to watch
their demeanour.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>It was no light matter being in charge of
a Prince on board ship. Mr. Cato found it best
during the daytime to keep him as much as
possible in his cabin, where he sat looking
patiently out of a port-hole, saying over new
words and phrases he had heard, or making
cigarettes with the little machine which Mr. Cato
carried about with him—a contrivance which
inspired him with far greater interest and awe
than the complications of the engine-room. It
was the best cabin on board, by-the-bye, for the
Shanghai merchant had insisted on giving it up
to the Prince. It was not that Dwala claimed
any outward signs of respect—he was modesty
itself; but his presence caused a certain <i>gêne</i>
among the other passengers, who were uncertain
whether to rise from their seats or not when he
entered the reading-room. Then he had no idea
of punctuality, and naturally nobody liked to
begin dinner until he came in. The sailors had
no end of a job enticing him down from the crosstrees,
where he had ensconced himself at the
sound of the dinner-bell. Then again, the chief
steward was nearly frightened out of his wits,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
when he leaned over his shoulder to offer him
potatoes, at the way the Prince grabbed his plate
and growled, under the impression that he wanted
to take it away from him. The passengers saw
but little of him till the last night of the voyage,
when they insisted on his presiding at the concert
in aid of the Sailors’ Orphanage. They were all
immensely impressed by the grave attention with
which he listened to the comic songs.</p>

<p>Mr. Cato was very busy all day going through
the evidence with the lawyer; and half of every
night he spent following the Prince in his swift
rambles over the ship, seeing that he did not get
into mischief. It was a relief when they landed
at last in England.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">VII</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first thing Mr. Cato did, when he had
settled his guest comfortably at home in Hampstead,
under the kindly care of his two sisters,
was to go and call on Lord Griffinhoofe, his
immediate political leader.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>Mr. Cato’s party was divided at this time into
many sections. An official leader had at one
time been appointed, but in the confusion of
politics the party had lost the papers and
forgotten his name. The leadership was now
divided among a number of eminent men, of
whom Lord Griffinhoofe, ex-Cabinet Minister and
member of one of the oldest and richest families
in England, was not the least. It was generally
understood that he would get an important
portfolio when a Liberal Government should be
formed, and the urbanity of his manner was held
to fit him peculiarly for the Foreign Office.</p>

<p>London was out of town when Mr. Cato
arrived. The Session was over; but Lord
Griffinhoofe was known to have come back on
business for a few weeks to his house in Piccadilly.
Mr. Cato found the blinds down, and
a charwoman washing the steps. He walked in
unannounced and entered the well-known reception-room
on the ground floor, disguised at
present with a furniture of linen bags, enfolding
monstrous shapes of large ornaments. Here he
found a flushed female, with a bonnet on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
side of her head, sitting on one of the long row
of leather chairs. She smiled and wagged her
feathers and roses at him pleasantly, assuring
him that ‘the good gentleman’ would be ‘out in
a jiffy.’ Mr. Cato seated himself modestly in a
dark corner and waited.</p>

<p>After a little while the inner door opened, and
Lord Griffinhoofe himself appeared—a large stout
man, with peering short-sighted eyes. He smiled
and nodded when he found himself confronted
by a curtseying female. Then he cleared his
throat, looked in three pockets for his eye-glasses,
wiped them, and examined the dirty scrap of
paper which he held in his hand.</p>

<p>‘Mrs. Waggs?’ he said.</p>

<p>‘Yes, my lord,’ said the smiling woman in the
bonnet; ‘that’s my name, sir, after my dear
’usband who went to the bad.’</p>

<p>‘Well, and what can I do for you?’</p>

<p>‘Mrs. Waggs, my lord, that’s my name. I’ve
come to be cook, ’earin’ as you was in want of a
temp’ry from my good friend Mrs. ’Amilton, who
washes the steps, pore thing, of a Saturday when
the other lidy ’as to be at ’ome.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>Lord Griffinhoofe examined the paper very
carefully, and cleared his throat again.</p>

<p>‘H’m! It’s very awkward. My wife’s away. I
hardly know what to do. You’re a cook, you say?’</p>

<p>‘Mrs. Waggs, my lord. Good plain or fancy
with the best of character’s, though short, bein’ a
temp’ry.’</p>

<p>‘Can you ... can you dust things, Mrs.
Waggs?’</p>

<p>‘Dust? Me dust? No thank you, my lord,
not if I know it. Thank ’Eaven, I ’aven’t come
down to a duster quite as yet. O no, thank you!
Mrs. Waggs, plain or fancy, on the usual terms,
but no dustin’, thank you! I’m not an ’ousemaid.’</p>

<p>‘It’s very awkward. So you want to be cook.
Can you make pastry?’</p>

<p>‘Anythink in reason, my lord. One doesn’t
ask too much of a pore woman with two children
and an ’usband in trouble. Pastry is not my
fort, nor ’ave I been accustomed to families where
pastry was eaten on a large scale.’</p>

<p>‘Well, well. It’s very awkward. The fact
is that I <i>have</i> a cook already.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>‘And well you may, my lord, you that might
’ave dozens for the askin’.’ Mrs. Waggs burst
into tears. ‘But it’s ’ard on a pore woman
that’s trudged miles an’ miles without a drop
o’ drink to look for a job, to be told the place is
bespoke.’</p>

<p>‘There, there, don’t cry, Mrs. Waggs. I
can’t turn my cook out to make a place for you,
can I?’</p>

<p>‘An’ my pore ’usband in trouble, ’im that
never did an ’ard day’s work in ’is life before.’</p>

<p>Clouds veiled the serenity of Lord Griffinhoofe’s
countenance for a little while, then he
passed his hand over his face and emerged with a
bright idea.</p>

<p>‘How would it be if you saw the cook and
had it out with <i>her</i>?’</p>

<p>Mrs. Waggs, paying no direct attention to
this proposal, nor to the next proposal to come
back in a few days and see what could be done
then, but continuing merely to repeat her name
and claims, Lord Griffinhoofe finally decided that
the best thing he could do was to ring the bell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
and consult the housekeeper. A lean woman in
black presented herself, glanced quickly round,
and listened with sour submission while Lord
Griffinhoofe explained the situation and its
difficulties.</p>

<p>‘Shall I deal with the woman, my lord?’</p>

<p>‘I shall be extremely grateful, Mrs. Porter.
I hardly know what to do myself.’</p>

<p>Three short steps brought the housekeeper in
front of Mrs. Waggs.</p>

<p>‘Now then, out you go! March!’</p>

<p>Mrs. Waggs quailed and rose obediently.</p>

<p>‘Comin’ here in such a state—the idea!’</p>

<p>The housekeeper shut the front-door behind
the visitor, and returned demurely the way she
had come.</p>

<p>‘Thank you, Mrs. Porter,’ said Lord Griffinhoofe,
with a nervous smile: ‘I thought you would
know what was the right thing.... And what
can I do for you, Madam?’ he inquired, stumbling
on Mr. Cato. ‘What, Mr. Cato! So you’re
back. How stupid of them to keep you waiting
in here. Come along! Come along!’</p>

<p>He led him into his study beyond.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>‘So you’ve come back for the great fight. It’s
a secret—I had a wire this morning—you mustn’t
tell anyone; we’re within measurable distance of
a General Election.’</p>

<p>‘Yes; I saw it in the “Westminster” last
night.’</p>

<p>‘Really! How <i>do</i> these papers find out?
It came on me quite as a surprise. I’ve been
promised—practically promised the—h’m! h’m!
It’s a dead secret, mind; you mustn’t let it
out.’</p>

<p>‘Why, the “Westminster”....’</p>

<p>‘They had that in too?’</p>

<p>‘No; in fact they mentioned Lord Rosebery.’</p>

<p>‘Bosh!’</p>

<p>‘Only guesswork, of course,’ added Mr. Cato
hastily, seeing an uneasy flush on Lord Griffinhoofe’s
face. ‘Quite impracticable! Not a man
we could work with.’</p>

<p>‘A mere talker!’</p>

<p>‘With the Eastern Question looming....’</p>

<p>‘A man who can’t say No!’</p>

<p>‘Russia needs a firm hand....’</p>

<p>‘Rosebery’s no more capable of managing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
Russia than I am of managing a ... well,
a ... well.... And what was it you came
to see me about, Mr. Cato?’</p>

<p>Mr. Cato entered with great detail into all
the facts of Prince Dwala’s case. The great man
rubbed his fat knees and assumed a sagacious
look; his breath came very short, and suddenly
he looked as if he were going to cry.</p>

<p>‘Wait a moment, Mr. Cato. If I had a bit
of pencil, I should like to put your facts down,
so as to get a clear idea. In what year do you
say he was born?’</p>

<p>‘I haven’t a notion. These facts aren’t
important enough to make a note of.’</p>

<p>‘Then you oughtn’t to tell me them. It only
confuses.’</p>

<p>‘The important thing is: how far will the
Party help him?’</p>

<p>‘We shall want a pencil for that. It’s such a
nuisance my secretary being away. He always
has a pencil. He takes his holiday now. Couldn’t
we put it off till Parliament assembles?’</p>

<p>‘The matter is urgent.’</p>

<p>‘Everything seems so urgent nowadays,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
Lord Griffinhoofe smiled sadly, as if remembering
better days.</p>

<p>‘We must secure the best lawyers at once.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, it’s a law case! I see.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I’ve told you so already; an appeal to
the Privy Council. Colonial appeals go before
the Privy Council.’</p>

<p>‘I remember. That’ll be the Judicial Committee,
no doubt. Well, can’t <i>they</i> settle it?’</p>

<p>‘That isn’t the point. It’s a most difficult
question of law, and everything depends on how
the question is argued. We must get the very
best counsel we can. The expenses are enormous.’</p>

<p>‘Can’t the ... er ... the what’s his name
manage it?’</p>

<p>‘Prince Dwala? We have no right to ask it
of him. His fortune is very small, for a Prince;
and I look upon the British nation and the
Liberal Party as trustees to see that he gets it
intact. I myself have already incurred very heavy
expenses.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, you shouldn’t spend your own money.’</p>

<p>‘That’s just it; I want the Party to help with
their funds.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>‘Well, well; if the cause is a good one. We
might wait a few months, and see what people
think.’</p>

<p>‘But the case will be over.’</p>

<p>‘One can’t help that. We mustn’t rush
things.’</p>

<p>Nothing could budge the great man from his
attitude of caution and delay. It was evident
that, in the absence of his secretary with the pencil,
he conceived only the vaguest idea of the question
in hand. Mr. Cato went home at last, expressing
the heroic resolution to fight the case on his own
money, even if it ruined him.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">VIII</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Cato’s</span> work was no light matter. He followed
the case in every stage; he explained it all
to the solicitors, and re-explained it to different
layers of barristers. Every new document was
submitted to him for revision. He was tormented
all the time by anxiety for the future; his fortune
was not a large one, and he had to reduce his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
capital to a very serious extent in order to meet
the preliminary expenses of the case. The Prince,
his guest, must indeed miss no comfort in his
house; but in every other respect he enjoined
the strictest economy on his sisters.</p>

<p>There were other things also to be thought
of. The Prince’s ignorance on many subjects
was astonishing; his questions showed it. This
was, of course, natural in a native; but if he was
to be a social success in England, then, in spite
of his age, it was necessary that he should have
some education. The Prince raised no objection.
He had taken quite a fancy to Miss Briscoe, who
appeared at first in the character of a guest at
lunch, with no suggestion of the governess about
her. A big genial woman of fifty, with thick
black eyebrows, and an indomitable belief in the
Christian fellowship of all men in this wonderful
world, she brought light into Dwala’s life.</p>

<p>For it must be confessed that the Prince’s
first impression of this long-desired civilisation
was one of disappointment. It was undoubtedly
dull in Mr. Cato’s house. Mr. Cato was out all
day; and though his aunt was a dear old lady in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
her way, and his sisters two of the most charitable
creatures in the neighbourhood, nobody would
have called them lively company for a Missing
Link. The indoor life told upon his health; the
clockwork regularity of the daily round and the
entire absence of events reduced his spirits to the
lowest depth. He had been accustomed in his
childhood to the happy vicissitudes of forest life;
to the pleasure of escaping thunderstorms and
beasts of prey; to the relief of calm sleep after
weeks of storm-rocked trees; to the wild delight
after long hunger of finding more than he could
eat. It maddened him to hear these old ladies
chattering over tiny pulsations of monotony as it
they were events; to hear them discussing the
paltry British weather under an impervious roof;
to hear them talk of burglars in the next parish
as if they were tigers on the lower branches;
to learn that Julia’s quarrel with Mrs. Armstrong
had ended in changing her doctor, when
he had pictured her tearing handfuls of fur out of
Mrs. Armstrong’s back. He longed to throttle
the smug butcher who brought the daily tray of
meat, robbing life of all the pleasure of desire.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>When he first arrived the Prince had been so
easily amused. It was enough for him to sit at a
window and watch the men mending the road; to
follow the housemaid from room to room and see
her make the beds; to help to screw a leaf into
the dining-room table; to dust Mr. Cato’s books.
It was, therefore, a great surprise to his host
when he blurted this out one evening. Had it
been one of his nephews from the country—his
youngest sister married the Rector of Woolcombing—Mr.
Cato would have known what to
do; he would have treated him to some of those
amusements which are provided for country
nephews; taken him to the British Museum,
South Kensington, the Tower of London, or the
College of Mining in Jermyn Street; he would
have contrived little outings on omnibuses, ending
with tea at an Aërated Bread shop. But the
Prince seemed too old for these things; the
weather was bad; Mr. Cato was busy, and he
had determined to keep him at Hampstead till
things had settled down and he knew his proper
social value.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">IX</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">That</span> was one of Mr. Cato’s chief preoccupations.
What was the Prince’s social station in England?
How much deference might be demanded of the
world? Who were the people to whose company
he had a natural right? One must neither
prejudice his future by assuming too low a value
for him, nor expose him to any rebuff by claiming
too much.</p>

<p>The question was one beyond Mr. Cato’s own
competence. His thoughts turned to his nephew
Pendred. Not a country nephew this, with any
implication of humbleness. Quite the contrary;
Pendred Lillico, ex-Lieutenant of the Grenadiers,
son of Mr. Cato’s half-sister, who had married
a hitherto obscure baronet in the days of her
beauty. Pendred was a dancing man, a well-known
man, a pattern of manners, an arbiter of
fashions. They rarely met: Mr. Cato was secretly
afraid of his nephew; Pendred seldom had occasion
to boast of his uncle.</p>

<p>He arrived on his motor-car—small, fair,
translucent, admirable. The occasion suited him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
Appreciation was his <i>métier</i>—appreciation of
frocks, laces, china, women, men. He knew hallmarks,
pottery-marks, marks of breeding, marks
of coming success. Mr. Cato passed the morning
before his arrival in a restless state; he was
nervous as to the verdict.</p>

<p>‘How much a year, do you say?’ asked
Pendred, in his touching little glass voice.</p>

<p>‘Two thousand.’</p>

<p>‘H’m ... Borneo.... Can I see him?’</p>

<p>‘But that makes no difference, does it?’</p>

<p>‘It’s everything.’</p>

<p>‘But, surely dukes and millionaires aren’t
estimated on their personal value?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, once you get into big figures!’</p>

<p>‘But a man’s social value....’</p>

<p>‘Social value, my dear uncle, is human
value.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I’m delighted to hear it.’</p>

<p>‘On two thousand a year, that is.... Well,
let’s see your man. I think I shall be able to
give you an opinion.’</p>

<p>Prince Dwala was seated in an armchair in the
library—nursing the fire, remote, abstracted. So<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
abstracted that he took no notice of their
entrance. Pendred put his head on one side and
tried to sketch a rough estimate; he was puzzled.
He put his head on the other side and attempted
a new valuation. Mr. Cato touched the Prince on
the shoulder.</p>

<p>‘I’ve brought you my nephew to make your
acquaintance.’</p>

<p>Dwala gave a long sigh and looked up.</p>

<p>‘Nephew ... what’s a nephew?’</p>

<p>‘<i>This</i> is my nephew,’ said Mr. Cato, presenting
Pendred, who stepped delicately forward,
smiling, with hand extended.</p>

<p>The Prince drew him towards himself. Then
suddenly, without any warning, as if it were the
most natural thing in the world, he took him up
in his arms and carried him to the light to make
a better examination. Mr. Cato stood petrified.
Pendred lay perfectly still, looking up with
frightened blue eyes. Dwala seated himself on
the edge of the table by the window, and put
Pendred on his knee. It was the first finished
product of civilisation that he had seen, perfect
at every point. He smelt him; he stroked his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
hair and ears; he felt the fineness of his clothes;
and growled a deep guttural growl of delight.</p>

<p>‘I should like to have a nephew, too.’</p>

<p>‘Put him down, put him down,’ cried Mr.
Cato, finding voice: ‘you mustn’t treat Pendred
like that!’</p>

<p>Dwala glided obediently off the table, set
Pendred on a chair, and crouched at his feet
looking up.</p>

<p>‘Does it talk?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘That’s right. Of course he does. Pendred’s
a terrible chatterbox. He’ll talk your head off.’</p>

<p>‘Please make it talk.’</p>

<p>‘How can he talk when you frighten him to
death like that?’</p>

<p>‘Don’t be absurd, Uncle Wyndham,’ said
Pendred plaintively: ‘I’m not at all frightened,
thank you.’ He pulled out his case of gold-tipped
cigarettes, and lighted one, at which
Dwala growled again and clapped his hands.</p>

<p>‘Did you have a jolly voyage? I hear you
were quite a lion on board. Terrible long
journey. Awful bore travellin’. What do you
think of England?’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>‘Pretty voice! pretty voice!’ said the Prince,
stroking one of his little boots. ‘Will it eat?
He pulled a biscuit out of his pocket and put
it up to Pendred’s lips. Pendred slipped his legs
away and jumped up.</p>

<p>‘No, thanks awfully. I must be gettin’
home. People to tea. Awful bore.’ And with
this he bolted straight out of the door and
through the house to his motor-car, which was
snorting and jumping up and down outside, in
charge of a man in shiny black surrounded by
a crowd of ragamuffins. He was half-way down
the road when Mr. Cato emerged in pursuit.</p>

<p>The Prince sat by the fire, nodding his head
in high spirits, and ejaculating: ‘Awful bore!
Awful bore!’</p>

<p>‘How dare you?’ said Mr. Cato, coming in a
moment later, and shutting the door behind him.</p>

<p>‘Dare what?’</p>

<p>‘How dare you treat my nephew like that?
Pendred! A gentleman! A future baronet!
Here am I, working my fingers to the bone to
get justice done to you—at it night and day,
spending my substance, sacrificing everything—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
then, when I invite my nephew out here,
who might have helped you in your London
career, you treat him like that! You drive him
out of the house—he even forgot his gloves.’</p>

<p>‘I liked him. I wanted to keep him.’</p>

<p>‘You treat him like a child, like a plaything,
a doll. You forget that he is a man.’</p>

<p>‘Is he a man?’</p>

<p>‘He was twenty-eight in June. Of course
he’s a man.’</p>

<p>‘I didn’t know. He has no eye.’</p>

<p>‘No eye? What do you mean?’</p>

<p>‘Nothing here.’ The Prince moved his hand
over his eyes. ‘Nothing behind.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know what you mean. Eye or no
eye, I’ll beg you for the future to be respectful
to <i>everybody</i>, mind you—<i>everybody</i>, high or low.
Social position makes no difference. Now you’ve
spoilt everything. Pendred’s offended. He won’t
come back. How can you get on if you behave
like that?’</p>

<p>Mr. Cato had heard of a man ‘having a leg,’
but never of a man having ‘no eye.’ It conveyed
nothing to him. But the idea was clear and even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
elementary to Dwala. Being a beast, endowed
with no reason, having only instinct and that
μονὴ αἰσθήματος, or persistence of impressions,
which takes the place of reason in the lower
animals, he was incapable of the rational classification
of natural things which characterises the
human outlook. His criteria of species were
distinct but illogical; his categories did not tally
with human categories; they fell short of them
and they overlapped them. Species was defined
for him, not by the grouping of attributes, but
by an abstract something—a spiritual essence
inherent in the attributes. He was guided, to
put it in philosophical terms, not by ‘phenomena,’
but by ‘noumena.’ For instance, he knew a
horse from a donkey, not by its size, its ears, or
its coat, not on consideration, but abruptly,
instinctively, round the corner, by an effluence
of individuality; in short, by its ‘equinity.’ So
too, in the forest, he had always known a venomous
cobra from a harmless grass-snake at any distance,
not by considerations of form or colour—considerations
which might often have led to too
late a conclusion—but merely by its ‘cobrinity.’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
But this attitude is liable to error; and Prince
Dwala had been led astray by it. His notion of
the essence of humanity was formed from the
men he had first met; it was limited and imperfect.
It included an element not essential to
humanity, this ‘eye’ of which he spoke: a thing
difficult to define; something revealed in the
bodily eye; not exactly strength of will or power
to command; not entirely dignity or courage;
some reflection rather of the spirit of the universe,
a self-completeness and responsibility, a consciousness
of individual independence. This he had
known and felt in the American, in the Soochings,
in Mr. Cato, in the housemaid—it was the basis
of his respect and obedience; but it was wanting
in Pendred Lillico.</p>

<p>It was fortunate that he was disabused of
error so early in his career. He could afford to
laugh at his foolishness later—he saw what
mistakes of behaviour it would have led him into;
for when he came to know London better, he
found that the mass of people, both in drawing-rooms
and slums, indubitably men, altogether
lacked the ‘eye’ which he had thought essential.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">X</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> breakfast next morning Mr. Cato groaned a
good deal over his letters.</p>

<p>‘Well, Wyndham, what does Pendred say?’
asked sister Emily.</p>

<p>Mr. Cato frowned, and shook his head in a
menacing aside, enjoining discretion.</p>

<p>‘I was afraid so,’ he said, after breakfast, when
Dwala had retired to the study fire. ‘Pendred
is very pessimistic. Oh dear, oh dear! And
yet, who can say he is not right after the way he
was treated? “I am afraid that the same thing
cannot be said of your <i>protégé</i>. Quite apart
from his rudeness to me—of which I will say
nothing, if you will do the same—it is evident
that Prince Dwala is not a gentleman. Not at
present, at any rate. There is a <i>brusquerie</i> about
him which would do very well in a Hapsburg or
a Hohenzollern, but not in a deposed Borneo
Prince. He doesn’t know how to sit down; nor
in fact what to sit on. He doesn’t know what to
do with his hands; all his movements are too
large, and, as Lady Hamish would say, ‘too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
conclusive.’” Pendred won’t come to lunch on
Tuesday—I was afraid not; he leaves town on
Monday. However, there is a ray of hope. It is
really very generous of Pendred, considering. It
is certainly worth trying. “Gentlemen are made
as well as born. Captain Howland-Bowser acquired
it because he was determined to succeed;
and now nobody would know he was not a gentleman,
and in fact a very fine gentleman, and
received everywhere. Of course it is a secret. I
should never have known if Warbeck Wemyss had
not told me himself. Present the letter I enclose,
and let him see that you mean perfect discretion.”’</p>

<p>‘Who is Warbeck Wemyss? Not <i>the</i> ...’</p>

<p>‘Of course.’</p>

<p>‘The actor?’</p>

<p>‘Gives lessons in manners, do you mean?’</p>

<p>‘But won’t it be very expensive?’</p>

<p>‘Of course Wyndham means the Prince to pay
himself.’</p>

<p>‘Now Clara, once for all, let me hear no more
of these hints. The Prince shall <i>not</i> pay. We
have no right to expect it, poor fellow. We have
done very well without going to the country this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
year, and surely we can manage to do it again.
If the worst comes to the worst we can move into
a smaller house when the Prince leaves us. You
must try to be more economical; the bills come
to far more than they ought to.’ He closed the
discussion by leaving the room.</p>

<p>Warbeck Wemyss consented, on terms. It
was a ‘wrench,’ as Traddles would have said;
but surely it was worth while. The lessons were
a great amusement for the Prince. The going
out into the passage; the entering the library, hat
in hand; the surprise on Mr. Wemyss’s part; the
little interchange on health and weather; the
play with his monstrous gloves: the more elaborate
lessons; introductions; forgetfulnesses; the
assumption of grave interest while a humble
Wemyss endeavoured to recall to him where they
had met before; the pretended dinners; the
new words; the manner of gallantry; the manner
of confidence; the gestures and ejaculations of
patience under a long anecdote—a thousand
situations which pictured a new and delightful
universe before his eyes. Dwala had the imitative
faculty in perfection; he almost cried with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
humble joy when Wemyss clapped him on the
shoulder, and assured him that he would make a
gentleman of him in no time. Mr. Cato was
delighted with the teacher’s reports: a little slapdash
at first; rather random in the use of
‘rippin’’ and ‘awful bore,’ but quicker progress
than he had ever seen.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">XI</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Meanwhile</span> there were other things to raise
Mr. Cato’s spirits. Parliament was back. The
Government still held good, it is true, in spite of
all rumours to the contrary; but opposition is
exhilarating. Best of all, the Privy Council was
in session. The Crown Officers, worn out with
long obstructive sittings, made a poor fight of it:
a dispute about a bit of land in Borneo was a
small matter compared with the fate of a historic
party. The judges were favourably impressed
by the brusque appositeness of Mr. Cato’s
counsel.</p>

<p>When Mr. Cato came back one day in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
four-wheeler instead of the omnibus, his sisters
knew that something extraordinary had happened.</p>

<p>‘We’ve won!’ he cried, sinking, smiling and
exhausted, into an armchair.</p>

<p>Everybody shook hands with Dwala.</p>

<p>‘Thank you, thank you,’ he said, pressing each
hand delicately, and laying his left hand on the
top of it, in a graceful and engaging way which
Mr. Wemyss had taught him. ‘You’re very kind.’
But he had no understanding of the news. Only
at dinner, when a gold-necked bottle of Christmas
champagne was produced and they all drank his
health, he began to realise that it was something
solemn and important.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">XII</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was more solemn than anybody suspected.
The news from the mines had been good; but it
was nothing to what it was going to be. When
Mr. Cato came home in the afternoon, two days
later, he found a smart brougham at the door.
On the hall table lay a card: ‘Baron Blumenstrauss.’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
The famous Baron in his house! The
drawing-room was empty. He went into the
library. There he beheld an elderly bald-headed
Jewish gentleman in a white waistcoat, with fat
little purple hands clasping his spread knees,
gazing with baggy eyes through dishevelled
gold pince-nez at Prince Dwala, who lay back
in an armchair, lids down, breathing heavily.
At Mr. Cato’s entrance, the visitor took off his
pince-nez and looked up.</p>

<p>‘It iss an extra-ordinary ting,’ he said: ‘de
shendlemann ’as gone to sleep!’</p>

<p>The Prince awoke at this and leaned forward
blinking.</p>

<p>‘Pray continue. It is <i>most</i> interesting.’</p>

<p>‘I am not used to ’ave my beesness bropositions
receift in soch a way. I am Baron
Blumenstrauss,’ he said, turning to Mr. Cato,
with gurgling guttural r’s.</p>

<p>‘Yes?... I am Mr. Cato—Mr. Wyndham
Cato ... I ... I live here, you know.’</p>

<p>‘Ah—sit down, Mister Cato. I ’ave read your
speeches. You are cleffer man; you ’ave ideas;
wrong ideas, bot cleffer. What can I do wid a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
shendlemann dat go to sleep when I make him
beesness bropositions? I offer to make him very
rich man, he say “rippin’”; I say four hunderd
tousand pount a year, he shut his eye; I say <i>fife</i>
hunderd tousand pount, he go to sleep.’</p>

<p>‘Five, hundred ... thousand ... pounds!’
ejaculated Mr. Cato faintly, overwhelmed.</p>

<p>‘Effery year.’</p>

<p>‘Why?’</p>

<p>The Baron winked ponderously, with an
effort, and smiled with exquisite penetration of
Mr. Cato’s labyrinthine slyness.</p>

<p>‘Nod for nussing!’</p>

<p>‘What is the proposition?’</p>

<p>‘Are you de shendlemann’s guardian?’
returned the Baron abruptly.</p>

<p>‘Why no,’ reflected Mr. Cato: ‘I suppose I
am not. But I’m his principal adviser.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! I know.’</p>

<p>The Baron rose suddenly, snatching up his
white-lined hat and lavender gloves.</p>

<p>‘Well, goot-bye, shendlemen. I haf laties
wait for me at home. Adieu, mon Prince.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Good</i>-bye, <i>good</i>-bye,’ said Dwala, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
careful intonations: ‘I hope you’ll look in again
some time.’</p>

<p>‘Goot-bye, I leaf you to your books, your
studies. Goot-bye ... Dis vay?’ he appealed
to Mr. Cato, moving towards the door.</p>

<p>‘I’ll see you out.’</p>

<p>‘Goot! You haf charming leetle house.
Man can see dat Madame haf excellent taste.’</p>

<p>He stopped at the hat-rack, took down a hat
and put it into Mr. Cato’s hand, nodding and
smiling.</p>

<p>‘Put him on. You come wid me.’</p>

<p>‘I wasn’t going out.’</p>

<p>‘Come alonk. I make you beesness broposition.’
He hurried him down the steps. ‘Leedle
flower’s all dead,’ he said, half glancing at the
wintry garden. ‘Half-past seex,’ he added, looking
at his watch.</p>

<p>As they bowled along in the smooth brougham,
night fell. The Baron talked; Mr. Cato began to
see dimly the gigantic outline of the thing that
he had done. His mind was still numbed with
the vastness of big figures; he hardly perceived
the order in which things happened. The Baron<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
had drawn a paper from some recess of the
carriage and put it in his hand; he was fascinated
by the purple unconscious forefinger striding
about it, and the continuous voice in his ear. It
was a map, a copy of the map of the Sooching
forest made by the lawyers: ‘As shown in the map
appended hereto, and marked C,’ he repeated to
himself. Yellow squares, and circles and figures
in black had grown on the bare centre since he
last saw it. The purple blood-gorged finger was
running rapidly from pit to pit; they were all
full of gold, and the finger was peeping and gloating
and chuckling, planning schemes of union and
division, conquest and annihilation. The coachman’s
steady back looked in with its two silver
eyes from the box, like the face of a giant
Fate, rumbling and gliding them to inevitable
ends.</p>

<p>The burst of a barrel organ brought him to
everyday consciousness. The Baron was still
talking.</p>

<p>‘“Are de Government mad?” said my friends
to me. “Dey might haf taken de whole ting wid
deir retchiment of men; and dey let it all go to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
one shendlemann. An’ now dere can neffer be a
war for it; it is brivate broperty. Dey leaf it to
de Soochinks? Goot! Someday de Soochinks
rebel; dey oppose de Ettucation law, de Tynamite
law, de Church law: de Government take it away
from dem. Goot! Dat is Bolitics. But dey
have made it Broperty: dere is no Bolitics wid
Broperty. We shall see big row. De Government
will fall.”’</p>

<p>‘They have many things to answer for.’</p>

<p>‘It is solid gold!’</p>

<p>‘Ten thousand butchered Bulgarians lie at
their door.’</p>

<p>‘Polgarrians? What are your ten tousand
Polgarrians to me, ten hunderd tousand Polgarrians,
ten million Polgarrians? A tousand
tons of solid gold, I tell you. Dey know nussing,
your Government. All de land is one big reef.
I haf known it tree munt, you haf known it,
efferybody haf known it; but de Government
knows nussing, de Brivy Gouncil knows nussing.’</p>

<p>‘Do you mean that the gold runs right across
this map, where these marks are?’</p>

<p>‘Natürlich.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>‘I never even guessed it.’</p>

<p>‘Is it a choke? Bah! Den why haf you made
soch friends of de Brince?’</p>

<p>‘What’s your proposal?’</p>

<p>‘Wait!’ He put his head out of window
and shouted to the driver: ‘Kvicker! Kvicker!’....
‘I tell you at home. Haf a smoke?’
He held out a fat cigar-case.</p>

<p>‘No thank you.’</p>

<p>‘Take it! take it! Fifty pount a box.’ Mr.
Cato still refused.</p>

<p>Gates opened before them; they drove over a
gravel court, and ascended broad steps on a red
carpet rolled down by footmen.</p>

<p>‘To de English room.’</p>

<p>They flew through a monstrous hall, with
three footmen after them; fountains, palms,
mosaics, tiles, pillars, galleries, lights; a card-table,
dwarfed by the vastness; card-players,
lounging men, thin contemptuous women smoking
cigarettes. As they bowled rapidly by, the
Baron waved flickering red fingers:</p>

<p>‘My exguses laties. Come along Max:
beesness!’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>A young Jew arose from the table, threw
down his cards, made apologies, and followed
quickly.</p>

<p>In the English room the Baron cast rapid
gestures at the pictures on the walls:</p>

<p>‘Reynolds, Cainsborough, Dicksee, Constable,
Leader, Freeth. Come along, Max. Bring champagne,’
he said to the footmen.</p>

<p>‘Not for me, thank you,’ said Mr. Cato.</p>

<p>‘Goot! I will drink it mysailfe.’</p>

<p>They sat in a blaze of electric light, velvet,
gold, Venetian glasses; everything exhaled a fat
smell of luxury. This was the stunning atmosphere
in which the Baron preferred to make his
‘broposition.’ Papers flitted about the table;
champagne and diamond rings flickered before
Mr. Cato’s eyes.</p>

<p>The Baron planned an amalgamation, a monopoly;
harmony and understanding; big handling
and cheap production; the sales regulated; the
market chosen; the rate of exchange manipulated.
A mass of companies, with different names,
different directorates, even different supposititious
localities.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>‘If I call him Cato Deeps, and say he is in
Mexico, who knows? who cares? De enchineer?
I pay him. De public? De diffidends are all in
Treadneedle Street.’</p>

<p>An oscillation of good reports and bad
reports, share-prices going up and down, with the
Baron and his friends in the middle of the see-saw,
and money rolling to them from alternate
ends of the plank.</p>

<p>‘Gold is goot, but gompanies are better,’ he
said.</p>

<p>But the Baron must have a free hand; it
amounted to a purchase, a right to exploit.
Everything depended on the Prince, and evidently
the Prince depended on Mr. Cato. For the one
there waited the 500,000<i>l.</i> a year in perpetuity,
guaranteed on his own property; for the other,
directorships, fees, shares, pickings at every
corner; a safe income of at least ten thousand to
be had for the asking. He had only to get the
Prince’s consent to the bargain.</p>

<p>Mr. Cato flipped aside the personal question
without a word. But for the Prince? 500,000<i>l.</i>
a year. No one could reasonably ask more of life.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
Had he a right to refuse it? But these companies!
tricks of promotion! all the garbage of
the money market. Had he a right to accept it?
He hesitated.</p>

<p>The butler came in, and murmured in the
Baron’s ear.</p>

<p>‘Where?’</p>

<p>‘Just outside, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Gif him a smoke, and tell him to vait.’</p>

<p>‘Can I come in?’ said a voice at the door.</p>

<p>‘Aha, cher Duc!’ cried the Baron with
brazen-voiced, brutal <i>bonhomie</i>: ‘go to de pilliard
room and vait.’</p>

<p>‘Can’t you spare a moment?’</p>

<p>‘Ne voyez-vous pas?’ The <i>bonhomie</i> passed
to imperial fierceness. ‘I am peezy!’</p>

<p>‘Well?’ he said, as Mr. Cato still sat plunged
in thought. ‘For you it is leetle question—for
de Brince, leetle question: it is me or somebody
else. Fife hunderd tousand pount, effery
year.’</p>

<p>Mr. Cato still pondered. He thought he saw
his duty clearing before him.</p>

<p>‘Well? De Duke vaits; I vait. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
impoverish de world: you widdraw me from
circulation. Is it Yes?’</p>

<p>‘No!’ said Mr. Cato, pushing back his chair.
‘It is No.’</p>

<p>‘Ah?... Who will manage de mines?’</p>

<p>‘The Prince will manage the mines. <i>I</i> will
manage the mines.’</p>

<p>‘Goot! You hear, Max? Dis shendlemann
will manage de mines.’</p>

<p>Max only stared palely at Mr. Cato. The
irony was too great for laughter. He saw a man
putting to sea on a plank, unconscious of the deep
voice of the gathering tornado; a child going out
with a wooden gun to make sport of an angry
crowd of <i>sans-culottes</i>.</p>

<p>‘Can I get a copy of the corrected map anywhere?’
asked the Child.</p>

<p>‘Gif him de map, Max,’ said the Baron, with
a short, indulgent laugh. ‘My secret achents haf
brepared it, Mr. Cato. Gif him de figures, all de
papers. Let him haf efferyting. Goot-bye, Mr.
Cato. See him to de carriage, Max.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll walk, thank you.’</p>

<p>‘Better drive. Goot-bye.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>‘Good-bye.’</p>

<p>‘You will haf deeficulties, Mr. Cato.’</p>

<p>Mr. Cato went home by omnibus. His heart
sank as he looked at the map, divorced from the
purple finger.</p>

<p>There is lightheartedness in great conflict:
we see the larger outline; our forces are fed by
the consciousness of it. A field of gold, still in
possession; a thing still to sell, if need be: it
was an impregnable position. But courage is
needed after the battle; we see partially, at short
range. To have rejected a magnificent offer, to
have so little in its place—some papers, an idea, a
consciousness that needed an atlas to explain it.
To have rejected the proposals of confident
authority creates a helpless mid-air terror; that
is the power of religions. Mr. Cato felt like a
heretic of the Middle Ages, wondering, on the
way to the stake, if after all the Pope were not
right.</p>

<p>He went straight to his bedroom; walked up
and down in his slippers, lay awake for hours in
long moods of elation and depression, and fell
asleep at last very cold.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIII</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> wheel had begun to turn. Nothing could
stop it now. Next morning came a fresh-looking
elderly gentleman in grey, who announced himself
as ‘of the Colonial Office.’ He looked about
him as if he meant to buy the place; but
modestly, as if for someone else. Mr. Cato
received him in the drawing-room. He hoped
the Prince was well. The Colonial Office had
heard of the Prince’s improving fortunes. His
business concerned the Prince, but it could most
conveniently be broached to Mr. Cato. He
would see the Prince afterwards.</p>

<p>It had probably struck Mr. Cato that the
time had now arrived for the Prince to set up a
separate establishment. The Colonial Office,
which was ultimately responsible for him, felt
that Mr. Cato’s kindness must not be trespassed
on. He must not be allowed to monopolise the
Prince.</p>

<p>Mr. Cato had probably noticed that native
potentates always had, what you might call, for
want of a better word, ‘keepers’ attached to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
their persons while they were in England. The
actual title varied. As a rule it was some tall
muscular military man who was said to be ‘in
attendance on His Majesty the So-and-so.’ It
was this functionary’s duty to keep him generally
out of mischief; for these Oriental fellows would
play the very deuce if left alone. Well, as far as
Prince Dwala was concerned, the Colonial Office
had decided that a Private Secretary would meet
the case, and they had in fact selected the man.</p>

<p>‘Who is it?’ asked Mr. Cato, repressing a
pang of jealousy.</p>

<p>‘One of the Huxtables—John Huxtable, a
son of the Bishop.’</p>

<p>This again smelt of large success. Mr. Cato
knew nothing of this particular John; but he
was a Huxtable, and Huxtables are, like Napoleon,
not men but institutions. Nature has such
caprices. Out of many million wild rough briars,
one rougher and crabbeder than all the rest is
chosen by her for a fathering stock; whatever is
grafted on it thrives. Another is richer, larger,
better-flowered, the pride of the field—it is wise,
courteous, a soldier, a leader of men; it is made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
a Duke; it is grafted with the delicatest buds of
Paestum. But the bloom is frail and mean;
shelter and fine feeding avail not, it has a good
place in the garden, but it is fragrant only in its
name. The Huxtables came of a rough and
crabbed stock. Their great-grandfather was
somebody’s gamekeeper. His sons throve in business.
His grandsons were great men—soldiers,
lawyers, priests. His great-grandsons, an innumerable
rising generation, were destined for
greater greatness. It had become an English
custom to see large futures before them. They
were big and bony, they played at Lord’s, they
abounded in clubs and country houses; their
handsome, strong-toothed sisters married well,
breeding powerful broad-browed babies that
frowned and pinched.</p>

<p>This particular Huxtable had tutored a Prince
of the blood. He had been secretary to a philanthropic
commission; he would be a Cabinet
Minister, a Viceroy—anything he pleased. For
the present he would be private secretary to
Dwala: he would manage him, regulate him,
assert him, protect him, establish him, marry him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
perhaps, and pass on to another broad stage in
the regal staircase of his career.</p>

<p>As for the mines, the gentleman in grey had
no advice to offer. It was a private affair of
Prince Dwala’s; no concern of the Colonial Office.
Why not consult some big financier? Baron
Blumenstrauss, for instance.</p>

<p>Mr. Cato made no reply.</p>

<p>‘Well, after all,’ the grey gentleman concluded,
‘it had better be left to Mr. Huxtable.’</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">XIV</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Huxtable came later—a terrifying young
man, who said little, but listened with a tolerant
smile—and after him a host of others, entailed
by his plans for Dwala. A house had been found
in Park Lane. The owner, who was travelling in
the East, had left the thing intact; his creditors
wished to sell it as it stood. The appointments
were passable; he had been a rather random collector
of good things—some rubbish must be
weeded out and replaced, but there was nothing
to delay possession.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>However, it must be paid for. If Mr. Cato
would produce his accounts, the Huxtable would
be glad to go through them with him.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I have no accounts to show.’</p>

<p>‘Why not?’</p>

<p>‘Dwala has been my guest. There is nothing
to account for.’</p>

<p>‘But the property in Borneo—you have an
account of that?’</p>

<p>‘No.’</p>

<p>‘This is all very curious. A man has a fortune
of some hundreds of thousands a year, and no
account is kept of it!’</p>

<p>‘But he hasn’t got it yet. It lies buried in
the earth in Borneo.’</p>

<p>‘Yes; it consists of mines, I know. But, of
course, the fortune was realisable as soon as the
Privy Council gave their decision.’</p>

<p>‘Well, it hasn’t been realised.’</p>

<p>‘But the decision was given a week ago. Do
you mean to say it has been <i>neglected</i> all this
time?’</p>

<p>‘“Neglected” is a piece of impertinence, Mr.
Huxtable.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>‘A week’s income lost means something like
10,000<i>l.</i>’</p>

<p>‘How dare you come to me—me, who has
been toiling night and day in the Prince’s interest—in
this authoritative, censorious way—I, who
am old enough to be your grandfather—talking
of neglect?’</p>

<p>‘You regard it as an aspersion? Well, and
what are the results of all your labour?’</p>

<p>‘I have secured him justice.’</p>

<p>‘Justice is a matter of law, Mr. Cato: the
Privy Council has attended to that. If you were
incapable of realising his fortune yourself, why
not have applied to some big financier—Baron
Blumenstrauss, for instance?’</p>

<p>‘I have seen Baron Blumenstrauss.’</p>

<p>‘Well, what did he say?’</p>

<p>‘He made an offer. He volunteered to buy
all the Prince’s rights for 500,000<i>l.</i> a year.’</p>

<p>‘Then, surely, you have realised it?’</p>

<p>‘No, sir, I have not.’</p>

<p>‘You don’t mean that you refused his offer?
You weren’t expecting anyone to offer more, I
suppose?’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>‘I refused his offer.’</p>

<p>‘On what ground?’</p>

<p>‘I regard Baron Blumenstrauss as an immoral
man. I regard his business methods as immoral.
If I had accepted the offer on the Prince’s behalf,
I should have been advising him to lend himself
to a vile system of exploitation, which I regard as
one of the most infamous curses of our modern
civilisation. I would rather see Dwala starve.’</p>

<p>‘You have taken a very great responsibility
on yourself, Mr. Cato.’</p>

<p>‘I am quite willing to bear it.’</p>

<p>A smile flickered round the Huxtable’s nose,
and Mr. Cato felt that he was being betrayed into
melodrama. Silence ensued.</p>

<p>‘Your sentiments are very noble, Mr. Cato,’
said Huxtable at last. ‘I should say that they
did you every credit, if it were your own fortune
that we were talking about. But it is not. And
if you think it over, you will see that your conduct
lies open to the very gravest criticism. By a
series of unusual circumstances you find yourself
practically master of the disposal of a vast fortune
belonging to someone else. Instead of accepting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
an excellent offer for the benefit of the person
whose interests you for some reason claim the
right of defending, you go off at a tangent in
pursuit of your own political theories.’</p>

<p>‘Political theories?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir; political theories. Your views are
well known. You regard the ways of the money
market as immoral; you preach saintliness in
the conduct of business; you think our social and
financial system a mistake; you are, in fact,
opposed to our civilisation as you find it. Those
are your politics. Excellent! Charming! That
is what makes your speeches a success. Moreover,
you have a perfect right to practise your
theories with your own property if you please.
This Sermon-on-the-Mount way of doing business
would make you a delightful customer in the City,
no doubt. But when it comes to Prince Dwala’s
affairs, the case is different. You are in the
position of a trustee.’</p>

<p>‘Then is a trustee to be without a conscience?’</p>

<p>‘Certainly not; that’s just the point. I
wonder you mention it. A trustee’s conscience
ought to be a very delicate affair.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>‘Do you mean to insinuate that I have acted
without conscience?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t insinuate it, sir; I say it straight
out. You have acted unconscientiously.’</p>

<p>‘You have the insolence to say that!’ cried
Mr. Cato, jumping up, with tears of fury in his
voice. ‘You dare to sit there and tell me I have
no conscience; you ... you damnable young
prig!’</p>

<p>The Huxtable sat with folded arms, looking
at him coldly, magisterially. This young untroubled
man was the World, the unrighteous,
unanimous World, sitting in judgment on him.</p>

<p>‘You don’t improve your case by losing
your temper and being abusive,’ said the World.
‘Your conscience, your whole conscience, should
have been bent on serving the Prince’s interests;
it was your duty to divest yourself of all personal
theories, all prejudices, all principles, and devote
yourself only to getting the best price you could.
You are not a business man, and you had no right
to experiment on the Prince’s behalf with theories
of business that never <i>have</i> worked, never <i>will</i>
work, and never <i>could</i> work. Nobody will offer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
you a better price than the Baron, because no
one can afford a better price.’</p>

<p>‘Well, you have succeeded me. There are
the mines intact. Go to the Baron and get him to
renew his offer.’</p>

<p>‘The Baron will not make the same offer
again.’</p>

<p>‘How do you know?’</p>

<p>‘Because I have seen the Baron.’</p>

<p>‘You have seen him!... Then all this long
discussion was a trap for me?’</p>

<p>‘You can call it a trap if you like, though
I think the word is a damaging one for you. I
have seen the Baron, and he at once stated that
he washed his hands of the whole affair.’</p>

<p>‘But if his only motive is money, things are
just as they were a week ago. He can still make
his money.’</p>

<p>‘You only expose your ignorance of the man
you were so ready to abuse—a man of unsullied
reputation, by-the-bye. Money is <i>not</i> his only
motive.’</p>

<p>‘What other motive has he?’</p>

<p>‘Pride.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>‘Him?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir; pride. When a man of that
magnitude steps off his pedestal and comes down
to a suburban house to offer his services to a
private individual, he expects to be treated at
least with consideration. He is accustomed to
dealing with Empires, Governments, National
Banks; not with obscure gentlemen in Hampstead
villas. What happened? The Prince fell asleep,
and you gave the Baron a blunt rebuff.’</p>

<p>‘It’s not my business to keep Prince Dwala
awake.’</p>

<p>‘It’s not your business to settle his affairs
while he’s asleep. You made an enemy of Baron
Blumenstrauss.’</p>

<p>‘The Baron’s enmity to me is of no importance.’</p>

<p>‘Quite true; of no importance. But you
made him the Prince’s enemy—an enemy of the
estate. He began negotiating against us at once,
floating companies over our head. He is omnipotent,
and you turned him against the Prince.
His pride was hurt.’</p>

<p>‘Surely he can swallow his pride!’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>‘No doubt; but not at the same figure. He
offers only 400,000<i>l.</i> a year.’</p>

<p>‘Well, what do you mean to do?’</p>

<p>‘I have accepted his offer.’</p>

<p>‘Ha!... I hope you made a good thing
out of it?’</p>

<p>They both rose to their feet.</p>

<p>‘In what way, Mr. Cato?’</p>

<p>‘There was, I suppose, some commission
attached to the negotiation?’</p>

<p>‘No, sir; there was no commission. Baron
Blumenstrauss knew me better than to offer me
any such thing.’</p>

<p>It was perfectly true. It would have been
inapt. There were other ways in which the
Baron could discharge his debt of gratitude to a
young man with a great future.</p>

<p>‘Where is the Prince?’ said Huxtable.</p>

<p>‘What do you want with him?’</p>

<p>‘I am going to take him into London.’</p>

<p>‘His house isn’t ready.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, it is. Will you make out your bill?’</p>

<p>‘What bill?’</p>

<p>‘For the expenses of his keep.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>‘He has been my guest, I tell you.’</p>

<p>‘As you please. Where is he now?’</p>

<p>‘He has gone for a walk with his governess.’</p>

<p>‘I will wait for him.’</p>

<p>This imperturbable young man sat quietly
down in an armchair and cracked his thumb-joints.
Mr. Cato looked at him with silent
wonder, and left the room. He envied the
Huxtable his nerves: his own were in a tumult;
he could not have stayed with him a moment
longer.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Meanwhile</span> Dwala, all unconscious, was standing
on Parliament Hill, with Miss Briscoe’s tall
figure at his side. It must have been some unwitting
prescience which took them there that day.</p>

<p>London lay at their feet: London, which
Dwala had never seen; London, where his life
would lie from this day forth. Not the formless,
endless, straight-ruled London seen by the man
in the street; not a pervading, uniform, roaring,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
inevitable presence: but London apart; in the
distance; without sound; without smell; set to a
foreground of sun-beaten grass and a gambolling
wind from the fields and seas; a thing with a
shape; a whole; bounded, surrounded, grim and
grimy, sprawling down the dishonoured valley;
murky, random, ridged and toothed, like the
<i>débris</i> of Ladoga’s ice, piled in the Neva by
December.</p>

<p>Dwala laughed.</p>

<p>It was a joke of a magnitude fitted to his
monstrous mind. ‘Man is the laughing animal:’
he had proved himself human. Behold, he had
worshipped Man and his inventions; he had come
forth to see the sublimest invention of all; he
had travelled over half the world for it; everywhere
they spoke of it with awe. And now he
had seen it. It was London.</p>

<p>The hill shook with his laughter. All the
birds and beasts in the big city heard it and
made answer—cheeping, squeaking, mewing, barking,
whinnying, and braying together; forgetful,
for the moment, of their long debates on
the habits of mankind, their tedious tales of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
human sagacity, their fruitless altercations as to
whether men had instinct or were guided only
by reason.</p>

<p>The commotion escaped Miss Briscoe’s notice:
she heard only one deep guttural laugh beside
her, and looking up, beheld a grave impassive
face.</p>

<p>‘There is St. Paul’s: do you see, Prince?
How grand it looks, watching over the great city
like a shepherd over his flock. “Toil on, toil on,
my children,” it seems to say: “I am here in the
midst of you, the Church, the Temple builded of
the lowly Carpenter, with my message of strength
for the faint-hearted, consolation for the afflicted,
peace for all when the day’s task is done. Toil
on, that the great work may be accomplished at
last.”’</p>

<p>‘Work? Ah, you may well say work,’ said a
voice from the bench beside them.</p>

<p>An old man was sitting there; a handsome
old man, with a strong, bony face. His knobbed
hands rested on the top of a walking-stick, his
chin on his hands. He wore the unmistakable
maroon jacket and black shovel-hat of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
workhouse; corduroys clothed his lean and
hollow thighs.</p>

<p>‘Bless you, there’s work for everyone as
<i>wants</i> to work. See that chimney down there,
that biggun? That’s Boffin’s, where I was.
Three and fifty years I worked at Boffin’s.’</p>

<p>‘Was it a happy life?’ asked Miss Briscoe.</p>

<p>‘Happy? Bless you, the times I’ve had there
when I was a youngster. Always up to larks.
There’s three of my grandsons there now.’</p>

<p>Miss Briscoe admired his furrowed, placid face.
‘Take this,’ she whispered.</p>

<p>The old man looked coldly at a shilling.</p>

<p>‘No, thanky ... but if the gentleman has
some tabacca on him, I could do with a bit.’</p>

<p>As they neared the bottom of the hill, Mr.
Cato came hurrying towards them. There were
tears in his eyes, and wet hollows in his cheeks.</p>

<p>‘Well, Dwala my boy, I’ve brought you news.
You’re going into London to-night, to your new
home.’</p>

<p>Dwala put up his face to the sky and laughed
again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dwala</span> was a social success, an object of multiple
affection. His large grave ways, his modesty,
his kindliness, made him personally beloved. He
was, of course, always a ‘native’; there was no
escaping that. But to be tolerated, if you are
tolerated everywhere, is social greatness.</p>

<p>One thing he lacked, they said—the sense of
humour. The tiny shock that makes a human
joke was too slight for his large senses. But
humour, after all, is a rather bourgeois quality.</p>

<p>He was adopted from the beginning, pushed,
trumpeted, imposed, by that powerful paper
the ‘Flywheel.’ He had captivated Captain
Howland-Bowser, its correspondent, at the first
encounter. The ‘Flywheel,’ descending after a
century, from its Olympian heights, into the
arena of popular favour—by gradual stages,
beginning with the great American ‘pill competition’—had
put itself on a level with the rest
by adding a column of ‘Beau Monde Intime’ to
its daily issue. The thing was done on the old
Olympian scale. The column was not entrusted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
to a chattering magpie-newswoman, or to a broken-winged
baronet, as is the way with lesser sheets;
but to an eagle of the heights—the famous
Captain Howland-Bowser, our modern Petronius,
the Grand Old Man of Pall Mall; the Buck from
Bath, as envious youngsters called him; the well-known
author of ‘Furbelows’ and the ‘Gourmet’s
Calendar.’</p>

<p>The fateful evening is recorded in his
‘Memoirs of a Man about Town,’ that farrago
of entertaining scandal, which proved a mine of
wealth to his sorrowing wife and family, to whom
he bequeathed the manuscript when he died, as a
consolation for a somewhat neglectful attitude in
life:</p>

<p>‘It was at Lady L——’s that I first met
Prince D——, that “swart monarch” whose
brilliant career, with its astonishing <i>dénouement</i>,
made so much stir in 19—. I remember that
evening well. We had supper at the Blackguards;
<i>homards à la Cayenne</i> with <i>crème de crevettes</i>,
<i>cailles Frédérique</i>, <i>salade Howland-Bowser</i>, &amp;c.,
&amp;c. Tom Warboys was there, gallant Tom;
Harry Clarke, of Sandown fame; Lord F——<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
(Mrs. W——’s Lord F——); R——, the artist;
poor H——, who shot himself afterwards; and a
few others. W-rb-ck W-m-ss came in later, and
delighted the company with some of his well-known
anecdotes. We formed a brilliant little group
in the dear old club—Adolphe was in his zenith
then. The Prince was in great form, saying
little, but enjoying all the fun with a grave
relish which was all his own. R—— was the
only blemish in the galaxy; <i>il faisait tache</i>, as
the volatile Gaul would say. H—— was getting
hold of him at the time to choose some pictures
for the Prince’s “’umble ’ut” in Park Lane. R——
raised a general laugh at his own expense when I
pressed him for an estimate of Grisetti’s “Passive
Resistance,” the gem of our little collection.
The knowingest men in London were agreed
that it was not only one of the wittiest pictures
of the year, but the girl the man was kissing
was the most alluring young female ever
clapped on canvas. R—— valued it at twenty
pounds—the price of the frame! We roared.
It had cost a cool two thousand, and was
worth at least five hundred more. So much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
for experts! He was very chapfallen the rest of
the evening.</p>

<p>‘However, <i>revenons à notre mouton</i>, as the
gay Parisians said, when the siege was raised
and <i>bottines sauce souris</i> went out of fashion.
It was at the supper-table that Prince D——
revealed that extraordinary delicacy of perception
which first opened your humble servant’s eyes to
what a pitch refinement can go. His manners,
by-the-bye, were unimpeachable: stately, and yet
affable. <i>Non imperitus loquor.</i> But the amazing
thing was his palate. There are delicate palates
in London—though many who pose as “men of
culture” have little or none—but the delicacy of
Prince D——’s was what I should call “superhuman,”
if subsequent events had not proved
that this extraordinary gift had, by some topsy-turvy
chance, fallen to the lot of one who, I
suppose, after all, we must now acknowledge
“sub-human.”</p>

<p>‘I had just brought to what I thought, and
still think, perfection, a mixed claret, on which I
had been at work a long time. The waiter had
his orders. “<i>Fiat experimentum</i>,” said I, and three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
bottles, unmarked, were brought. Every one at
table was given a liqueur glass of each to taste.
The company mumbled and mouthed them, and
each one gave a different opinion—all wrong.
The poor “gamboge-slinger” admitted at once
that he didn’t know port from burgundy: I had
suspected as much.</p>

<p>‘“Well, Prince,” said I, “what’s your
opinion?” To my astonishment I saw that he
hadn’t touched a drop. He sat quite still, leaning
back in his chair; his nostrils quivered a little.
Suddenly he put out one of his long fingers—his
hands were enormous—and touched what I shall
call, for short, “Glass A.”</p>

<p>‘“That is a good wine,” he said, “the same as
we had at home night before last.” He turned
to poor H——.</p>

<p>‘“Château Mauville,” said H——.</p>

<p>‘“And that,” he said, touching Glass B, “is
thin and sour; it smells of leather. And that,”
he said, touching Glass C, “is a mixture of the
two, and very good it is.” Saying which, he
drank it off and licked his lips.</p>

<p>‘“Gentlemen!” cried I, jumping up; “this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
is the most extraordinary thing I ever heard.
Without tasting a drop, the Prince has guessed
<i>exactly</i> right. It’s Château Mauville, which I
have mixed—a sudden inspiration which came
to me one morning in my bath—with an inferior
Spanish claret, tinged with that odd smack of
the wine-skin, which I thought would fit in with
the rather tea-rosy taste of the Mauville.”</p>

<p>‘You can imagine the excitement which this
event produced in that coterie of <i>viveurs</i>. From
that moment his success in London was assured.
The story got about, in a distorted form of
course, as these things will. I was obliged to
give the correct version of it in the “Flywheel”
a few days later.</p>

<p>‘It was I that introduced him to Lord X——,
who had been complaining for years that there
wasn’t a man in town fit to drink his Madeira.
Trench by trench the citadel of public
opinion was stormed and taken. How well I
remember,’ &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Prince Dwala</span> succeeded by other qualities than
those attributed to him. His wealth raised him
to a high tableland, where others also dwelt; it
was not his fine palate which raised him higher,
nor was it his manners. His manners, in point of
fact, were not perfect; his manner perhaps, but
not his manners. The finest manners were not to
be learnt in the school of Warbeck Wemyss, as
he quickly perceived; that was only a preparation,
a phase. Captain Howland-Bowser, who
believed his own success to be due to that schooling,
was mistaken; he underrated himself: his
success was greatly due to his fine presence, but
still more to the fact that his intelligence stood
head and shoulders higher than that of most of
those with whom he was thrown into contact;
and he had confirmed his pre-eminence by his
literary fame.</p>

<p>Prince Dwala’s popularity was chiefly due to
the zeal, the zest, the frenzy, with which he threw
himself into the distractions and pursuits of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
best society. He missed nothing: he was everywhere;
wakeful, watchful, interested. He was a
dancing man, a dining man, a club man, a racing
man, an automobilist, a first-nighter. His dark
head, groomed to a millimetre, his big figure,
tailored to perfection, formed a necessary feature
of every gathering.</p>

<p>Nor did he hold himself aloof from the more
serious pursuits of the wealthy: he was at every
meeting, big or small, that had to do with
missionary work, temperance, philanthropy; he
visited the Geographical Society, the Antiquaries,
the Christian Scientists, and the lady
with the crystal globe in Hanover Square.</p>

<p>He was up early, walking through the slums,
or having his correspondence read to him. Tired
rings grew round the Huxtable’s eyes; the Prince
was as fresh as paint. He was studying ‘the
Human Question.’</p>

<p>We will not follow him through all the
details of his social life: the limbo of frocks and
lights, the lovely people, the unlovely, the endless
flickering of vivid talk, the millions of ideas,
all different in outline but uniform in impulse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
like the ripples on the Atlantic swell. We come
at once to the great day when he met Lady Wyse.</p>

<p>Strange that such a meeting should have
marked the day for him as great. Not strange
that it should be so for you and me: for us it
has inner meanings, implications of success; it
marks the grandeur of our flight; it has high
possibilities. Who knows but we may catch the
fancy of the lovely creature, be admitted freely to
her familiar fellowship; penetrate thereby to the
very innermost arcana of the Social Mystery?</p>

<p>But for him—a monster of the forest, an
elemental being—that happiness should date from
his first meeting with a woman whom we must
call after all frail, the fine flower of all that is
most artificial and decadent in England: that
was strange. But so it was.</p>

<p>He had studied; he had seen; he knew the
human question to the bottom. But what to
make of it? Was this all? Discontentment
gnawed him. He suffered a deprivation, as once
in the forest, when he lacked Man. Now he had
had Man, to the full; he was sated. What
more?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>Lady Wyse understood his want, and helped
him to supply it. He must reduce himself,
limit his range to the human scale; he must put
off his elemental largeness and himself be Man;
be less—an Englishman, a Londoner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Lillico’s</span> evening was crowded. ‘This is
quite an intellectual party to-day,’ she said,
shaking hands with Dwala and Huxtable, and
leading them down the avenue which opened of
its own accord in the forest of men and women.
‘Such a number of literary people. <i>How</i> do
you do, Mr. MacAllister? It’s an age since we’ve
seen you; and this is your wife, isn’t it? To be
sure. Let me introduce you to Prince Dwala....
That was Sandy MacAllister, the author of
“The Auld Licht that Failit”—all about those
dear primitive Ayrshire people; everybody’s so
interested nowadays in their fidelity and simplicity
and religiousness and all that. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
Kirkyard School, they call it. It’s a pity his
wife’s so Scotch. Lord Glendover is here....’</p>

<p>‘Cabinet Ministers, Oho!’ said Huxtable.</p>

<p>‘And Lady Violet Huggins, and the Duke
of Dover, and Sir Peter Parchmin, the great
biologist, and Sir Benet Smyth, and <i>both</i> the
Miss Dillwaters. And who else <i>do</i> you think
I’ve “bagged,” Mr. Huxtable?’</p>

<p>‘I can’t guess.’</p>

<p>‘Lady Wyse!’</p>

<p>‘Really? I congratulate you.’</p>

<p>‘Isn’t it splendid? She’s been so rude.’</p>

<p>‘Next thing I hear you’ll be having....’</p>

<p>‘S’sh.... General Wapshot, that fierce little
man over there, came with her; we didn’t ask
him, but he always goes wherever she goes. And
isn’t it dreadful, Prince, I asked Wyndham to get
Mr. Barlow to come—the new poet, you know;
and it turns out that he’s a pro-Boer too, and
<i>insists</i> upon reciting his own poems? There he
is at this very moment.’</p>

<p>In their course down the room they were passing
the door of a smaller apartment, given over
for the evening to a set entertainment. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
could see a rumpled young man waving his arms
in there; they caught a whiff of him as they
went by.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">‘Theirs not to do or die!</div>
<div class="verse">Theirs but to question why!’</div>
</div></div>

<p>he was saying.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know <i>what</i> Mr. Disturnal will think;
that’s him, there’—she indicated a muscular ruffian
with a square blue jaw, priest or prize-fighter,
one would have guessed, who was leaning against
the door-post listening over his shoulder with a
sardonic smile.</p>

<p>‘But, of course, you know all our celebrities
already, Prince. He’s the most coming man on
the Conservative side, they say; a staunch upholder
of the Church, with all the makings of
a really great statesman. It was he who saved
us only last week over the second reading of
that dreadful Prayer Book Amendment Act, by
borrowing a pole-cat in Seven Dials just in the
nick of time, and hiding it in the Lobby, so that
the supporters of the measure couldn’t get in to
vote. What a pity Julia isn’t here! I’m sure
he’s looking out for her. She’s just gone into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
the rest-cure; quite worn out, poor thing. We
live at a terribly high pressure, Prince; people
take life so seriously now. Oh, there’s the dear
Duke singing one of his delicious songs.’ They
were passing the door again on the return
journey, and the ping-pang of a banjo came
frolicking out on the air with a fat voice lumbering
huskily in pursuit:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">‘Oh, I always get tight</div>
<div class="verse">On a Saturday night,</div>
<div class="verse">And sober up on Sun-day,’</div>
</div></div>

<p>sang the Duke. Laughter followed with the
confused thunder of an attempted chorus. Mr.
Disturnal had shifted his other shoulder to the
door-post and was looking in, with open mouth
and delighted eye.</p>

<p>‘Isn’t it amusing?’ said Lady Lillico. ‘That
tall man with the white moustache over there is
Captain Howland-Bowser, quite a literary light.
You know him? He married one of the Devonshire
joneses; the Barley Castle joneses, you know,
with a small j.’</p>

<p>Pendred passed at this moment, with a hungry
lady of middle years hanging on his arm; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
slapped the Prince familiarly on the shoulder
as he went by. The awkwardness of their first
encounter had been quite lived down by now.</p>

<p>‘Oh, please introduce me!’ begged the lady.</p>

<p>‘What, to the Prince?’ said Pendred. ‘Oh,
you wouldn’t like him.’</p>

<p>‘I should <i>love</i> him.’</p>

<p>‘He has a most repulsive face.’</p>

<p>‘I <i>love</i> a repulsive face.’</p>

<p>‘He drinks like a fish.’</p>

<p>‘I <i>love</i> a man who drinks. Oh, Mr. Lillico,
we mustn’t be too censorious about the conduct of
great people; they are exposed to innumerable
temptations of which we know nothing.’</p>

<p>This was the famous Miss Dillwater, whose
<i>métier</i> in life was loyalty—loyalty to every kind
of Royal personage, but more particularly to the
unfortunate. From her earliest childhood her
dreams had been wholly concerned with kings
and queens; in the daytime she thought over the
clever answers she would make to monarchs whom
she found sitting <i>incognito</i> in parks, and pictured
herself kneeling in floods of tears when summoned
to the palace the next morning. She had pursued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
Don Carlos from hotel to hotel for years; and
only deserted his cause at last to follow King
Milan into exile. Every spring she returned to
London to lay a wreath on the grave of Mary
Queen of Scots, and to conspire with other
dangerous people for the restoration of Prince
Ferdinand of Bulgaria, our rightful monarch, to
the throne of England. Tears coursed down her
cheeks when Pendred introduced her, and it was
a considerable embarrassment to the Prince when
she seized his hairy hand and pressed it fervently
to her lips. She followed him about the rest of
the evening, with a melancholy smile on her wan
face.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Mr. Lillico,’ she said, in an aside to
Pendred; ‘I can never thank you enough. He’s
wonderful. That great jaw! those big teeth!
those long arms! that brow! He reminds me of
one of Charlotte Brontë’s heroes. I do love a
<i>man</i>!’</p>

<p>The Prince was one of the magnetic centres
of the gathering; the particles regrouped themselves
as he moved about from place to place.
There was one moment when he was comparatively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
deserted; everyone was crowding round a
lady in black; angry cries issued from the group.
Lady Lillico hurried up to him.</p>

<p>‘Pray come over here, Prince, and listen to
what Miss Dillwater’s sister is saying. She is
about to reveal <i>the</i> great secret about Guy de
Maupassant and Marie Bashkirtseff. She’s a
great literary authority, you know. I’ve not read
anything by either of them myself as yet, but
I’m <i>deeply</i> interested. We are all Bashkirtseffites
or Maupassantists now.’</p>

<p>But unfortunately, they were too late for the
secret; they came in only for the broken crumbs
of it.</p>

<p>‘I was Marie’s <i>greatest</i> friend,’ Miss Sophie
was saying; ‘and you may depend upon it, what
I tell you is true. <i>That</i> is the reason why they
never married. I am a delicate-minded woman,
and nothing should have dragged this secret from
me if I had not felt the overwhelming importance
of it to literature.’</p>

<p>‘The charge is false!’ bellowed a furious
voice.</p>

<p>‘The thing will have to be looked into.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>‘Well, whatever anyone says,’ cried a stout
woman, ‘I never <i>have</i> read this Bashkirtseff
lady’s diary, and I never <i>will</i>.’</p>

<p>‘And, pray, why not, Madam?’ snorted back
an elderly gentleman. ‘Maupassant is a fraud!
After what I have heard to-night, I disown him.
His books ought never to have been published.’</p>

<p>‘Hear, hear! And with him goes Zola, and
all the rest of them. What do you think, Lord
Glendover?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, me? I never can see what people want
with all these foreign fellers. John Bull’s good
enough for me.’</p>

<p>Attention was distracted at this point by a
new interest which had arisen on the outskirts of
the group. Sir Peter Parchmin, the great savant,
the petticoat pet—he had made a fortune in
fashionable medical practice, but was forgiven it
on his retirement, at fifty, in virtue of his new
claims as a researcher in biology—was wriggling
faint protests at the violence of a throng of
ladies who were propelling him, with the help
of a tall octogenarian buffoon, towards the centre
of the public.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>‘What’s up?’</p>

<p>‘Parchmin’s going to tell us the latest news
about the Missing Link,’ said the big buffoon.</p>

<p>‘Oh, a story about the Missing Link!’
exclaimed Lady Lillico. ‘This is most exciting.
Sit down everybody, and let us hear it. I <i>adore</i>
scientific things.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, what <i>is</i> the Missing Link?’ said a
young lady. ‘I’ve so often heard of it, and
wondered what it is.’</p>

<p>‘Well, ladies,’ said the Biologist, taking the
centre, and reconciling himself very readily to
the situation. He fondled and smoothed his
periods with undulating gestures of the long
sleek freckled hands. ‘You’ve all of you heard,
no doubt, of Darwin?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, yes,’ everybody chorussed.</p>

<p>‘What, Sir Julius Darwin, who bought Upton
Holes?’</p>

<p>‘No, no, Lord Glendover,’ explained Lady
Lillico, ‘one of the Shropshire Darwins—a very
well-known scientist.’</p>

<p>‘Ah!’ said Lord Glendover, sinking back
and losing all interest.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>‘Well, when he traced the relationship
between Man and the ... er, Anthropoids....’</p>

<p>‘Oh, please don’t use technical terms, Sir
Peter!’ cried Lady Lillico. ‘We’re none of us
specialists here.’</p>

<p>‘Well, let us say the manlike apes ...
when he had traced the relationship, there was
still one place left empty in the ... er ... so
to speak, in the genealogical tree.’ The Biologist
emitted this with a grin. ‘No remains have
ever been found of the hypothetical animal from
which man and the apes are descended: and this
link, which is still lacking to the completeness
of the series, has therefore been called the Missing
Link.’</p>

<p>A very young soldier, with a handkerchief
sticking out of his sleeve, leaned forward at this
point, blushing deeply:</p>

<p>‘Then do I understand you, sir, that we are
not actually <i>descended</i> from monkeys?’</p>

<p>‘No, not actually descended.’</p>

<p>‘How very curious!’</p>

<p>‘Fancy! This is something quite new.’</p>

<p>‘They certainly ought not to have attacked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
Genesis till they were more sure of their
ground.’</p>

<p>‘How amusing of them to call it the Missing
Link!’</p>

<p>‘Sort o’ pun, eh?’</p>

<p>‘But what’s the story, Sir Peter?’</p>

<p>‘I’m coming to that.... Now, we may
roughly put the date of the Missing Link from
which we are descended at about three hundred
million years ago.’</p>

<p>An ‘Oh!’ of disappointment ran round the
ladies. The representative of the ‘Flywheel’
gave a ‘Humph!’ and walked off, to look at
himself in the glass.</p>

<p>‘But wait a moment,’ said the Biologist.
‘Though improbable, it is not impossible that
the species from which, by differentiation, arose
men on the one hand and apes on the other,
should have continued its existence, <i>undifferentiated</i>,
at the same time. And the rumour is
that there is at least one specimen of the race
still alive; and, what is more, that he was lately
in the possession of an American, and on the eve
of being shipped to England for exhibition.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>‘What an extraordinary thing!’</p>

<p>‘It’s <i>too</i> fascinating!’</p>

<p>‘Like those Babylonian hieroglyphics at the
British Museum.’</p>

<p>‘Yes; or radium.’</p>

<p>‘Or that rhinoceros in Fleet Street.’</p>

<p>‘But how <i>old</i> he must be!’</p>

<p>‘It is said that he escaped to the forest,’ continued
the Biologist; ‘and his keeper lost all trace
of him. We mean to raise a fund for an expedition
to find him.’</p>

<p>‘What’s the good of him?’ asked a surly
man—one of the Bashkirtseffites—abruptly.</p>

<p>‘The good, sir? It would be the most important
thing in Science for centuries!’</p>

<p>‘What good will it do the community, I
should like to know? Will it increase our
output, or raise the standard of comfort, or do
anything for Civilisation?’</p>

<p>‘Ha! now we’re getting into Politics,’ said
Lord Glendover, rising, and thereby giving an
impulse which disintegrated Sir Peter’s audience.</p>

<p>Howland-Bowser detached Prince Dwala from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
the group as it broke up, and drew him aside,
with an air of important confidence.</p>

<p>‘If you go to the refreshment room,’ he said,
‘<i>don’t touch the champagne that’s open</i>. Ask the
head waiter—the old man with the Newgate
fringe; if you mention my name, he’ll know.
It’s the ... ah ... ha....’</p>

<p>While he was speaking two figures emerged
vividly from the mass, coming towards and
past them. Eyes darkened over shoulders looking
after them. The straight blue figure of a
smooth slender woman, diffusing a soft air of
beauty and disdain; and half at her side, half
behind her, the Biologist, sly and satisfied, hair
and flesh of an even tawny hue, the neck bent
forward, equally ready to pounce on a victim or
suffer a yoke, balancing his body to a Lyceum stride,
clasping an elbow with a hand behind his back,
bountifully pouring forth minted words and looking
through rims of gold into the woman’s face, as it
were round the corner of a door, like some mediæval
statesman playing bo-peep with a baby king.</p>

<p>Lady Lillico was pursuing with tired and
frightened eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>Howland-Bowser cleared his throat and
shifted his weight on to one gracefully-curving
leg. Lady Lillico had caught them in their
passage.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Lady Wyse,’ she said, with a downward
inflection of fear, as if she had stepped in a hole,
‘may I introduce Prince Dwala? Prince Dwala:
Lady Wyse.’</p>

<p>The blue lady’s eyes traversed Howland-Bowser
in the region of the tropics with purely
impersonal contempt; he outlined a disclamatory
bow, and fingered his tie. The eyes reached
Dwala and came to anchor.</p>

<p>‘Oh, you’re the Black Prince,’ said Lady
Wyse; ‘the Wild Man from Borneo that everybody
talks about?’</p>

<p>Lady Lillico quailed, and vanished through
the floor. Howland-Bowser looked round the
room, chin up, and walked off with the air of an
archdeacon at a school-treat.</p>

<p>‘How delightful!’ pursued the insolent lady
slowly. ‘Of course you’re a Mahommedan, and
carry little fetishes about with you, and all
that.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>Her eyes were directed vaguely at his shirt-studs.
Looking down from above he saw only
the lids of them, long-lashed and iris-edged,
convexed by the eye-balls, like two delicate blue-veined
eggs. She raised them at last, and he
looked into them.</p>

<p>It was like looking out to sea.</p>

<p>She looked into his: and it was as if a broad
sheet of water had passed swiftly through the
forest of her mind, and all the withering thickets,
touched by the magic flood, had reared their
heads, put forth green leaves, blossomed, and
filled with joy-drunk birds, singing full-throated
contempt and hatred of mankind. The energy
to hate, seared with the long drought of loneliness,
was quickened and renewed by this vision of
a kindred spirit.</p>

<p>For she too was a monster. Not a monster
created, like Dwala, at one wave of the wand by
Nature in the woods; but hewn from the living
rock by a thousand hands of men, slowly chipped
and chiselled and polished and refined till it
reached perfection. Every meanness, every flattery
that touched her had gone to her moulding;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
till now she was finished, blow-hardened, unmalleable;
the multiplied strokes slid off without
a trace.</p>

<p>Her position was known to all; there was no
secret about it. The great blow that had severed
the rough shape from the mass was struck, as it
were, before the face of all the world. They
might have taken her and tumbled her down the
mountain side, to roll ingloriously into the
engulfing sea. Instead of that they had set
her on a pedestal, carved her with their infamous
tools, fawned round her, swinging Lilliputian
censers, seeking favour, and singing praise.</p>

<p>She was a monster, and no one knew it. And
now at last she had met an equal mind: her eyes
met other eyes that saw the world as she saw it—whole
and naked at a glance. There was no
question of love between them; they met in
frozen altitudes far above the world where such
things were. They were two comets laughing
their way through space together.</p>

<p>All the Biologist saw was an augur-smile
upon their lips.</p>

<p>‘Come along,’ said Lady Wyse, slipping her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
white glove through Prince Dwala’s arm. ‘Let’s
get somewhere where we can talk.’</p>

<p>‘Then what becomes of me?’ grinned the
insinuating savant.</p>

<p>‘Oh, you?’ said the lady. ‘You can go to
the devil!’</p>

<p>Captain Howland-Bowser looked enviously
after them as they left the room.</p>

<p>‘Your Borneo Prince has made no end of a
conquest, Baron,’ he said, finding Blumenstrauss—whom
he hated, by-the-bye—at his elbow.
‘H’m! H’m!’</p>

<p>‘Aha, my dear Bowser, wid nine hunderd
tousand pount a year one can do anysing.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What they could have to say to one another
in the window-seat, no one could imagine. They
were neither of them great talkers; everybody
knew that. Yet there was Prince Dwala, with
his grave face tilted to one side, eagerly drinking
in her words, answering rapidly, decisively; and
Lady Wyse giggling like a school-girl, blinking
away tears of laughter from her violet eyes. Such
a thing had never been seen. How long had they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
known one another? Never met till this evening.
Nonsense; he’s there every afternoon.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Whatever the subject of the duologue may
have been, the effect of it on Lady Wyse was
of the happiest kind. She was metamorphosed;
radiant, and, for her, gracious; transfused with
life, she seemed taller and larger than before.</p>

<p>The Huxtable’s grim face was wreathed, in
spite of him, in smiles; a flush of pleasure peeped
out from under his bristling hair as Lady Wyse
stopped Dwala before him and demanded an
introduction.</p>

<p>‘I’ve heard of you so often, Mr. Huxtable.
My father knew your uncle the Judge. I hope
you’ll come to some of my Thursdays.’</p>

<p>The scent of her new mood spread abroad like
the scent of honey, and the flies came clustering
round her. Chief among them Lord Glendover,
the Cabinet Minister, who had made four remarks
in the course of the evening—all of them foolish.
Tall, lean, hairy, brown and grizzled, he was one
of those men who, though neither wise, clever,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
strong, nor careful, convey a sense of largeness and
deserved success. He would have been important,
even as a gardener; he would have ruined the
flower-beds, but could never have been dismissed.
His only assessable claim to greatness lay in the
merit of inheriting a big name and estate. He
was, in point of fact, quite stupid; but his
opinions, launched from such a dock, went out to
sea with all the impressiveness of Atlantic liners,
and the smaller craft made way respectfully.</p>

<p>Sir Benet Smyth winged after him, buoyant
with the grave flightiness of diplomacy, and
luminous with the coming glory of his tour of
the Courts. For the Government, despairing of
reforms in the army, was meditating a wholesale
purchase of foreign goodwill, a cheap scheme
of national defence, founded on the precept, <i>les
petits cadeaux font l’amitié</i>. The details were not
yet made known, but rumour had it for certain
that the Spanish Infanta was to get the Colonelcy
of the Irish Guards, the Mad Mullah was to get
the Garter, and President Roosevelt was to get
Jamaica. It was also said by some that the
Government was going to strike out a new line in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
honorary titles by making the Sultan of Turkey
Bishop of Birmingham: but this was not certain.</p>

<p>Sir Benet and Lord Glendover sat down with
Dwala, the General, the Biologist, the Baron, and
Huxtable, in a semi-circle centring on Lady Wyse.</p>

<p>‘We’ve been wondering, dear Lady Wyse,’
said the Biologist, ‘what was the subject of your
engrossing conversation with the Prince.’</p>

<p>‘I can guess de sopchect,’ said Baron Blumenstrauss.
‘It was loff ... or beesness.’</p>

<p>‘You were so animated, both of you.’</p>

<p>‘Den it was bote. De Breence would nod be
animated by beesness, and de laty would nod be
animated by loff!’</p>

<p>‘Ha, ha!’ said Lord Glendover, vaguely
discerning the outline of an epigram; ‘that’s a
right-and-lefter.’</p>

<p>‘You’re quite right, Baron,’ said Lady Wyse:
‘it was both. We’ve been making a compact, I
think you call it. The Prince puts himself unreservedly
into my hands. I’m to do whatever I
like with him.’</p>

<p>‘Gompacts ...’ began the Baron, and
broke off.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>The Biologist looked as if he would like to
kick him, but lacked the physical courage.</p>

<p>‘I’ve been telling the Prince he’s too modest,’
said Lady Wyse.</p>

<p>‘P’r’aps you didn’t lead him on enough,’ suggested
the diplomat; at which the Biologist
vented a sickly grin, and Lady Wyse hit him very
hard with her fan.</p>

<p>‘Too modest about himself, I was going to say,
if I had a chance of ending my sentences with all
you wags about. A man of his talents oughtn’t
to be contented to loaf about doing nothing.
He might be anything with his intellect—a
great writer, or a scientist, or a diplomat, or a
financier.’</p>

<p>‘Or a tinker or a tailor, or a soldier or a
sailor,’ said the Biologist.</p>

<p>‘Do you think that I’m joking, you idiot?’
said Lady Wyse, emitting a cold shaft of light
that went to his backbone.</p>

<p>‘No, of course not, dear Lady Wyse! I was
only thinking....’</p>

<p>‘Soldier or sailor—confound you, sir!’ said the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
little General fiercely. ‘There’s no need to drag
in the services.’</p>

<p>‘No, no,’ said Lady Wyse: ‘we were talking
of intellect.’</p>

<p>‘One isn’t a scientist by wishing it,’ said the
Biologist. ‘One has to go through the mill.
Besides....’</p>

<p>‘Well, a diplomat, then. He’d look sweet
in a cocked hat.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, no really, Lady Wyse, I pro-test,’ said
Sir Benet; ‘you don’t know what a grind one
has.... Besides....’</p>

<p>‘Ah! I forgot,’ said Lady Wyse, playing with
her fan. ‘Prince Dwala’s a black. Isn’t he what’s
called a black, Sir Benet?’</p>

<p>‘Well, really, Lady Wyse!’</p>

<p>‘Don’t mind me,’ said Dwala.</p>

<p>‘No, no!’ interposed the Biologist: ‘it’s
quite a misuse of terms I assure you. The word
is applied loosely to Africans; but it is a mistake
to use it in speaking of the Archipelago.
The Soochings, as I understand, belong to the
Malayan family, with a considerable infusion, no
doubt, of Aryan blood. “Dwa-la,” “Two Names,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
is practically Aryan. So that the Prince belongs,
in point of fact, to the same stock as ourselves.
In fact, Lady Ballantyne mistook him for an
Englishman....’</p>

<p>‘She’s as blind as a bat,’ said Lady Wyse.
‘Still, black or white, he belongs to a very old
family.’</p>

<p>‘One of the oldest in the world,’ said Dwala.</p>

<p>‘Well, never mind. Shall we make a writer
of him? I’m sure that doesn’t require any
preparation.’</p>

<p>‘Ha, ha, that’s good!’ bellowed Lord Glendover.
‘Here, Howland-Bowser’—he beckoned
the journalist, who was hovering near the group.
‘Lady Wyse says any fool can be a writer.’ He
gripped him by the biceps, presenting him.</p>

<p>‘You know Captain Howland-Bowser, don’t
you, Lady Wyse, our great literary man?’</p>

<p>‘No,’ said Lady Wyse, looking calmly at her
fan: ‘never heard of him.’</p>

<p>‘Aha, Bowser!’ said the Baron, with a nod.</p>

<p>The Captain withdrew in good order, discomfited
but dignified.</p>

<p>‘You’re very discouraging, all of you,’ pursued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
the great lady. ‘I suppose the Baron is now
going to tell me that you have to study for
twenty years before you can set up as a money-lender.’</p>

<p>‘Dere is only one brofession,’ said the Baron
thoughtfully, ‘where one can be great man
widout knowing anysing; bot it is de most
eenfluential of all.’</p>

<p>‘What’s that?’</p>

<p>‘Bolitics.’</p>

<p>‘Capital!’ said Lady Wyse. ‘We’ll put
Prince Dwala in the Cabinet.’</p>

<p>Lord Glendover rose from his chair at this, in
what might almost be called a ‘huff.’ His gaunt,
important face hung over the group like the top
of an old Scotch fir.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know whether this sort of thing is
thought funny,’ he said, putting up his large
mouth to one side to help support the eye-glass
which he was busy placing. ‘But if you imagine,
Baron Blumenstrauss, that men are entrusted with
responsibility for the welfare of thirty-eight millions
of human beings without the most careful
process of selection, you are most confoundedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
mistaken. I never heard such a statement!
You’d like to have an entrance examination
instituted for Cabinet Ministers, I suppose?’</p>

<p>‘Excellent ideea!’ said the Baron.</p>

<p>‘Sit down,’ said Lady Wyse.</p>

<p>‘Then all I can say is ... you’re an Anarchist!
I’ve served my country for forty years,’ he
pursued, in a voice broken with emotion,
resuming his seat. ‘When I came down, a
bright young boy, from Oxford, instead of
running about amusing myself, as I might have
done, I slaved away for years in an Under-Secretaryship....’</p>

<p>‘This is all in “Who’s Who,”’ said Lady
Wyse. ‘We’re talking about Prince Dwala now.’</p>

<p>It was embarrassing and even painful to the
smaller quantities of the group to see that great
noble child, Lord Glendover, being shaken up
and dumped down in this unceremonious way.
The diplomat played with his hat, while
Huxtable and the Biologist kept very still, with
their eyes on the ground. Dwala himself might
have been looking on at a game of spillikins for
all the interest he showed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>‘Cabinet Meenister is beeg to begeen?’ propounded
the Baron tentatively.</p>

<p>‘It’s impossible!’ murmured Lord Glendover.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know whether you clearly understood
what I said about a “compact” just now,’ said
Lady Wyse, sitting back, beautifully inert, with
her hands in her lap. ‘It’s meant to be taken
quite literally. The Prince and I have entered
into an offensive and defensive alliance. Whatever
we do, we do in common. We have decided
that he is to be a Cabinet Minister. You see?
If it’s impossible, make it possible. You understand
me now, no doubt? I’m pretty clear.
You’ll have to exert yourselves, all of you.’ Her
eyes travelled slowly from face to face, looking
in turn at Lord Glendover, the Diplomat, the
Baron, the Biologist, and Huxtable.</p>

<p>‘Yes, you too, Mr. Huxtable.’</p>

<p>Then she suddenly yawned a cat-like yawn,
and sauntered forth to where Lady Lillico
stood.</p>

<p>‘Good-bye; I’ve had a charming evening. Is
this your boy?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, this is Pendred.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>‘He looks very presentable.’ She nodded and
passed on.</p>

<p>Lord Glendover and the Diplomat still sat
in their places when the little group dispersed.
Lord Glendover rubbed his knees. Their eyes
met at last, with the sly surprise of two naughty
boys who have just had their ears boxed; smiling
defiance, altruistically—each for the other; inwardly
resolving to incur no graver danger.</p>

<p>Lord Glendover had only one tiny grain of
hope left; he was uneasy till it was shaken out of
the sack. He caught Lady Wyse near the door.</p>

<p>‘Do you know that Prince Dwala isn’t a
British subject even?’</p>

<p>‘Isn’t he? Make him one.’</p>

<p>‘How am I to make him one?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, the usual way, whatever it is. Find
out.’</p>

<p>In the next room she was stopped again. The
Biologist came writhing through the grass.</p>

<p>‘I’ve thought of a little plan, dear Lady
Wyse, for starting Prince Dwala on his political
career.’</p>

<p>‘Have you? I hope it’s a good one.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>‘First rate. Our member, Crayshaw—he sits
for London University, you know....’</p>

<p>‘Hang the details! Ah, there he is!’</p>

<p>Prince Dwala, with his henchman at his side,
was lying in wait for Lady Wyse by the second
door.</p>

<p>‘Take the ugly duckling away,’ said Lady
Wyse; ‘I want to talk to the Prince.’</p>

<p>The Biologist buttonholed poor Huxtable and
walked him off. Dwala and Lady Wyse stood
face to face again.</p>

<p>‘Well?’ she said.</p>

<p>‘Well?’ he answered.</p>

<p>They remained for some time in a large, light,
comfortable silence.</p>

<p>‘I’d been looking forward to another talk
with you,’ said Lady Wyse.</p>

<p>‘Had you?’</p>

<p>‘But I see that we really have nothing to say
to one another.’</p>

<p>‘Absolutely nothing.’</p>

<p>‘And never shall,’ she added. ‘It wouldn’t
matter if we never met again.’</p>

<p>‘Not a bit.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>They stood looking brightly at one another
for a minute or two.</p>

<p>‘What fun it is!’</p>

<p>‘Grand!’ said Dwala.</p>

<p>She nodded and went home.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">XIX</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Hitherto</span>, Dwala had been great, but great only
in the relative sense, in comparison with you and me
and the Man in the Street; great to the capacity
of a vast austerely-fronted house in Park Lane;
overwhelming for us on the pavement who fancy
him within, infusing that big block with a huge
cubic soul; who catch glimpses of him whirling
out of the big gates to take tea, no doubt, with
Ambassadors and Duchesses, and whirling in
again with some real live Royalty—so rumours the
little crowd outside as the stout policeman touches
his helmet. Not immeasurable, however, to the
big-calibred folk who eat with him, talk with
him, see him starting on routes of acquaintance
which they have long since travelled:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
even to Huxtable, mere man, a calculable
quantity.</p>

<p>But a new movement was beginning, an upheaval;
volcanic forces were at work; the throes
of earthquake, striking premonitory awe into the
hearts of men, presaged a rearrangement of
geography. And slowly the Great World became
aware that a new mountain was rising in its
midst.</p>

<p>The Dwala Naturalisation Bill, introduced
in the Lords, had run a calm and rapid course,
and Dwala was an Englishman. The journals
recorded it without exultation: it was placed
among the ‘Items of Interest’ in the ‘Daily
Mail.’ But soon there followed articles on his
scientific interests: it appeared that he was
already an eminent philatelist; Huxtable had
bought big stamp-collections for him at the sales—Huxtable
had innocent tastes which he was now
able to enjoy by proxy. The Prince was interested
in Antarctic Exploration—at least, he had signed
a cheque for a thousand pounds for the Relief
Expedition; in astronomy, too, for he had promised
a new telescope to the Greenwich<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
Observatory. His claims to represent Science in
Parliament—since he had decided to go into
politics—were indisputable; and there was ground
for the rumour that London University had
settled upon him for their representative, provided
that one or two stipulations were fulfilled. If
not, the Government had a safe seat for him in
Cornwall.</p>

<p>His private life became a matter of public
interest. He had bought Wynfield Castle in
Yorkshire; he was fitting it with lifts and electric
light; the Saharan Emperor had promised to come
over for the shooting next autumn; Sir Benet
Smyth, who had arranged the visit, would be there.
There was no truth in the rumour of his engagement
to Lady Alice Minnifer, Lord Glendover’s
daughter; the rumour was at any rate premature.</p>

<p>Politicians began to frequent his ways: he
was not destined to be an ordinary humdrum
Member, paying a heavy price to be driven in
and out of lobbies by a sheep-dog; he was going
to be a power. Of what nature, nobody knew
exactly; his opinions could only be guessed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
That mattered very little. All the public has to
do is to get the big man and plant him in office;
party discipline will do the rest. There were
fifteen parties in Parliament, and only two lobbies
for them to vote in; leaders with opinions were a
drug in the market; better the large unifying
vagueness of a mind with none. Why he was to
be great no one clearly knew; the fiat had gone
forth from some hidden chamber of the citadel;
or it had descended inscrutably from heaven, or
risen on the breath of the sweating multitude:
anyhow, there was a general agreement of unknown
origin to magnify the name of Dwala.
These things are mysterious, and the responsibility
cannot be fixed till the time of recrimination
comes.</p>

<p>Huxtable was happy. Well he might be,
lucky dog! His uncles smiled and slapped him
on the back in public in their big successful way.
Lady Glendover remembered his face; Pendred
Lillico went about boasting that young Huxtable
had been his fag at Eton. These things were
pleasant to the Huxtable mind; pleasant also the
graciousness of Lady Wyse, who distinguished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
him at her Thursdays above his betters in the
social hierarchy.</p>

<p>Yet there were things in Park Lane that he
could have wished different. Of course he had
done what he could to the right human furnishing
of the big house; he had secured his patron
the necessary atmosphere of awestruck service,
silent efficiency and unassuming pomp. There
was the stout butler, who looked like a conscientious
low-church Bishop left over from a
dinner-party, eager to please but uneasy at
finding himself still there. He went about the
house silently in flat slippers, seeking a clue to
his identity, and looking out of window from
time to time, as if he meditated escaping in
search of his See. Tall scarlet footmen, with
white legs, borrowed from some giant balustrade:
stately animals, ‘incedingly upborne,’ like Vashti
in ‘Villette’—alert but always perpendicular,
eager as midshipmen to the domestic call,
blighting visitors at the entry with the frigid
consciousness of social difference. For the rest
of the economy, invisible hands and watchful
eyes; she-brownies that came and went unseen;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
bells that rang in distant corridors, summoning
punctual feet to unknown observances; green-baize
doors that swung and hid the minor
mysteries of the great life.</p>

<p>These things were good. But what of
Hartopp and the little girl?</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">XX</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Huxtable’s</span> advertisement in the ‘Morning Post’
had brought applications from 130 valets. It
brought also a letter from a country clergyman,
beseeking another chance for Prosser—ex-burglar,
son of a country poacher, a reformed character—lately
returned to his father’s humble home in
penitence from Portland, after five years of penal
servitude. The blameless, colourless remainder
had no chance against him. Dwala was delighted.
Prosser came—a little pale man, trim and finicking,
with shining eyes; nothing of the brutal house-breaker
in him; a man of patient, orderly mind,
who had gone to Burglary as another man might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
go to the Bar, because he had ‘influence,’ and no
aptitude for any other calling. With his father
to back him, he had a connection ready-made
among the ‘fences,’ or receivers of stolen goods.
He had not thought himself justified in throwing
away such chances with a wife and child to keep.
He studied the arts of valeting and butlering;
entered gentlemen’s houses with a good character
from a friendly ‘fence,’ and left them with the
jewellery and plate, till he was lagged over a
wretched little job in the suburbs, and taken
to Portland Bill, where one of his mates—a
fraudulent low-church company-promoter—converted
him and showed him the wickedness of
what he had been doing in all its coarse
enormity.</p>

<p>His wife had gone to the bad during his
absence, and the little girl had been adopted and
cared for by another friendly ‘fence’—an afflicted
villain of the name of Hartopp. So much he
had heard; but he had not enough the courage
of his new innocence to go into that dangerous
neighbourhood to find her.</p>

<p>Dwala elicited these facts in cross-examination.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
He was deeply interested in this new side of life;
and we must, perforce, follow him into it, though
it has little apparent relevance to the present
course of the story.</p>

<p>For Dwala’s political eminence is a ‘set piece’
which took some time in the preparing; and in
order to give the stage carpenters time to get
through with their work, it is convenient at this
point to get done with one or two necessary
‘flats.’ Besides, the social heights to which Fate
brought him are giddy places for those who have
not strong and accustomed heads, and it is safer
to descend now and then and amble in the plain,
among the greasy multitude that crawls so irrelevantly
below—despicable to the mountaineers,
who look down and mark the wind-borne cheers,
risking their heroic lives at every step among the
precipices, yet asking nothing more of the valley
than a distant awe, and a handful of guides and
porters, with baskets of meat, well-filled, and
topped with bottles of good champagne.</p>

<p>Prosser passed under the trees to Hyde Park
Corner, bound on his daily walk. His eyes were
bright, and the world swam by as unimportant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
as a dream; for Prosser, in the respectable seclusion
of his room, had taken to drinking—steady
drinking day by day, without resistance or remorse.
Life, to which he returned from jail with such
hungry imagination, had suddenly revealed itself
to him in its ugly arid nakedness: his conversion
and good resolutions had stripped it of all its
meaning; now it was an old worn billiard-table,
with no balls or cues to it; cumbering the room,
importunately present, grim and terrible in its
powers of insistent boredom. To hide from it—to
crouch and hide with his head between his
hands, against the dirty floor—that was the only
resource since he had renounced the game and
sent the balls away. He drank and was happy;
not actively happy, but deviating this way and
that into dreamy vacancy and strong disgust,
escaping the awful middle way of boredom. He
felt his control going, and he smiled triumphantly
at the coming of his hideous mistress. Often he
thought of walking into the servants’ hall and
boasting of his secret. But the coarse activity of
real life dispelled the longing as soon as he neared
his audience. He remained trim, upright, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
serenely deferent, with shining eyes and pursed
dry lips.</p>

<p>At Hyde Park Corner a little crowd was
gathered about a musician—an old man, with a
leg and a half and a crutch, and a placard
‘BLIND’ on his chest. He had just finished
a last shrill <i>bravura</i> on the penny whistle. A
respectable wet-eyed girl in black went round
with a bag and collected money.</p>

<p>‘<i>Pity</i> the poor blind!’ shouted the musician
in a sudden angry imperative.</p>

<p>Prosser wagged his head in a soliloquy of
recognition; and gazed giddily at the little girl.</p>

<p>‘Nobody got a penny for the poor blind?’
asked the angry voice.</p>

<p>‘’Ark at ’im,’ said a woman. ‘Why, the gal’s
got a nole ’at full!’</p>

<p>‘What girl?’ said the old man sharply.</p>

<p>At that moment the girl dodged through the
little crowd and disappeared, bag and all, down
Piccadilly.</p>

<p>‘Stop her! stop her!’ cried one or two ineffective
voices.</p>

<p>The old man dashed his penny whistle angrily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
on the ground, buried his face in his hands,
turned to the wall, and broke into shoulder-shaking
sobs.</p>

<p>‘What, ain’t that your gal?’ asked a compassionate
stout man in black, with a worn
leather bag, touching him gently on the heaving
shoulder—a dentist from the slums, one might
guess him at.</p>

<p>‘Small girl in black, was it?’ asked the blind
man.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I think so. I didn’t exactly notice.’</p>

<p>‘Sort of orphan-looking girl, very quiet?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, that’s her.’</p>

<p>‘That girl’s a——little blood-sucker!’ said
the old man. ‘Wherever I go, there’s that girl
comes and collects the coppers kind people mean
for me. Leave me alone, all of you! Clear out!
I’ve broke my whistle now, and haven’t a copper
to get another, let alone a crust of bread these
three days.’</p>

<p>‘What a shime!’ commented the crowd.
‘Call ’erself a gal! I’d gal ’er! A reg’lar little
Bulgarian, that’s what she is!’</p>

<p>‘Now, then, move on there,’ commanded a big<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
policeman, bearing down on the crowd, confident
in his own broad momentum, like a punt among
the reeds. ‘What’s all this?’</p>

<p>‘They’ve been robbin’ a pore blind man,
that’s what it is,’ said the benevolent dentist; at
which the policeman rounded on him sharply with
extended, directing arm.</p>

<p>‘Now then, <i>you</i> move on there!’ And the
dentist retired submissively in the direction indicated,
hovering in safety.</p>

<p>A benevolent, bent old gentleman, lately
helped by the porter down the steps of one of
the big bow-windowed clubs, came hobbling up
on three legs, and stopped and asked questions.
The policeman saluted. The little crowd closed
round them; the black helmet in the midst
leaned this way and that, arbitrating between
misfortune and benevolence. Judgment and award
were soon achieved; the black helmet heaved
and turned about, and the crowd scattered obediently
east and west.</p>

<p>‘What a nice old gentleman!’ said one of
many voices passing Prosser.</p>

<p>‘Give ’im a sovring, did he?’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>‘Don’t you wish <i>you</i> was blind, Miss ’Ankin?’</p>

<p>‘Lot of sov’rings <i>you’d</i> give me!’</p>

<p>‘Gow on!’</p>

<p>‘What did they take ’im up for then?’</p>

<p>‘On’y takin’ ’im over the road, stoopid.’</p>

<p>Prosser stood and watched the old man cross
in the constable’s grip; saw him loosed into
Grosvenor Place; followed, and watched him as
he clumped his way along the blank brick wall,
leaning forward from the crutch, grotesquely and
terribly, towards his extended arm, which beat
the pavement with a stick before him, driving
pedestrians to right and left, crying furiously as he
went ‘<i>Pity</i> the poor blind!’ and stopping now
and then to mumble the sovereign and chuckle to
himself.</p>

<p>Near Victoria Station he stopped, and
thrashed the kerb. A girl slipped out from
somewhere and took his arm; the same girl who
had so lately robbed him.</p>

<p>‘That you, Joey?’ said the blind man.</p>

<p>‘What luck, Toppin?’</p>

<p>The old man grinned.</p>

<p>‘Got a plunk, Joey; benevolent gent.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>‘My, what a soft!’</p>

<p>‘Just take me over to Victoria Street. Wait
at the Monico; ain’t safe here.’</p>

<p>Over the road he gave the sovereign into
her keeping, and she frisked up a side street.
Prosser followed him down Victoria Street, helped
him silently over the crossings, and was still
dreaming of one like himself, meeting an old
friend and lacking the energy to acknowledge
him; when the blind man turned suddenly and
grabbed him by the arm.</p>

<p>‘What’s your name?’</p>

<p>‘Prosser,’ he faltered.</p>

<p>‘I thought so. You’ve been drinking, you —— fool.
Where have you been all this time
since you came out?’</p>

<p>‘I ... I’m in service.’</p>

<p>‘Ah?’</p>

<p>‘I’ve turned over a new leaf. Was that my
little girl?’</p>

<p>‘That was Joey. Why?’</p>

<p>‘I only wanted to know.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! making conversation, as it were. Yes;
you’re gentry now, of course—joined the respectable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
classes.’ He fumbled Prosser’s coat as he
spoke, feeling round the cloth buttons to see if
they were sound and fat. ‘One has to talk for
talking’s sake when one belongs to the gentry.
Well, I’m off. Don’t waste your elegant conversation
on me; go back to the Duchess....
<i>Pity</i> the poor blind!’ He was off again, crying
hoarsely along the big grey blocks, and Prosser
pursuing timidly.</p>

<p>‘Stop, stop, Mr. Hartopp! You didn’t mind
my mentioning the little girl?’</p>

<p>‘<i>Pity</i> the poor blind!’</p>

<p>His appeal to the public was launched with
an abrupt intonation which implied a final ‘D——
you!’ as plain as words.</p>

<p>‘It’s <i>my</i> little girl after all,’ said Prosser.</p>

<p>‘Don’t talk like a d——d drunken maudlin
fool!’ growled the blind man, stopping short
again. People looked over their shoulders as they
went past, ladies from the Stores drew aside into
the road and hurried by, seeing this maimed old
man leaning back over his extended crutch, blaspheming
at the trim underling who stood so mild
and weak behind him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>‘I know your sort! rotten gutless puppies
that lose their grit as soon as they get under.
Portland; good conduct marks; conversion;
piety; ticket-of-leave, and then drink, drink, drink!
“Gone into service!” “My little girl!” Ugh!
What do you want to do with your “little girl”?
Would you like the little pet to “go into service”
too? and wear a little muslin pinafore, with
pockets in front? Speak up, man, speak up.
Don’t stand there like a sodden hog, dreaming
over your next big drink while I’m making conversation.
Don’t you hear me, you elegant toff?’</p>

<p>Prosser started guiltily.</p>

<p>‘I’d been thinking perhaps my employer would
find her a nice home somewhere.’</p>

<p>‘A little cottage in the country somewhere,
eh? with geraniums in the window and a little
watering pot all her own, eh? And what about
me? I’d make a pretty footman if you’d recommend
me, and stand on the steps in a salmon-coloured
suit and help the gentlefolk in and out
of their carriages.’</p>

<p>‘He’d do something for you, I’m sure. He’s
a very kind master.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>‘“A very kind master!” Oh, good Lord!...
<i>Pity</i> the poor blind!’</p>

<p>‘Mr. Hartopp, Mr. Hartopp!’</p>

<p>The old man stopped again and faced right
round.</p>

<p>‘Prosser, if you follow me an inch further I’ll
knock out your mucky fuddled brains with my
crutch all over the pavement. I swear I will.
Go home and soak, you sentimental skunk.’</p>

<p>Prosser stood still for some time watching the
angry figure bobbing down the road. Then he
turned up by the Turkish Baths and made his
way home.</p>

<p>That evening he related the whole of his
adventure to Prince Dwala, not even omitting the
confession of his own intemperance.</p>

<p>‘So you drink, do you? Drink too much of
course, that is.’</p>

<p>‘You’re not angry, sir?’</p>

<p>‘Of course not. Not a bit.... It must be
awfully expensive?’</p>

<p>‘I can’t help it, sir. I don’t want to help it.
Of course I’ll have to go?’</p>

<p>‘Go where?’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>‘Leave you, I mean, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, please don’t do that, Prosser. You shall
have as much as you need. Don’t have more
than you really need. I’m sorry it’s you, of
course, because I like you so much. But now
you explain it to me, I don’t see how it could have
been helped. I’m awfully sorry about it. That’s
a very wonderful old man.’</p>

<p>‘Mr. Hartopp? Yes, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Do you think he’d come and live here?’</p>

<p>‘He wouldn’t take service, sir.’</p>

<p>‘No, as a friend, I mean. You see, Prosser,
this house is much bigger than I really need. I
have to live in it, of course, because I’m so rich;
besides, there’s poor Huxtable to think of.’</p>

<p>‘You needn’t pity Mr. Huxtable much, sir.’</p>

<p>‘No, that’s true: I suppose he’s very happy.
Do you know anything about Mr. Hartopp’s
past life? One isn’t born a “Fence” I
suppose?’</p>

<p>‘Oh no, sir, it takes a very intelligent man
to be a Fence. Mr. Hartopp’s a very intelligent
man, and had a first-class education.’</p>

<p>‘What’s his story, then?’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>‘Story, sir? There’s no story as far as I ever
heard. Nothing out of the ordinary, sir.’</p>

<p>‘How did he become blind?’</p>

<p>‘Overwork, sir. He was a schoolmaster as a
young man down in our part of the country, and
overworked his eyes like at his work, sir. That’s
how he lost his place. He had a fever, and they
took him to the Workhouse Infirmary. It’s that
what made him go to the bad, they say, sir; he’d
always had a horror of the rates. He often talks
of himself as a pauper, as if it was a disgrace like.
He’d worked his way up like, sir, and couldn’t
stand being mixed up with pauperism. So when
they discharged him he came up to London and
went to the bad.’</p>

<p>‘Drink, I suppose? It always begins that
way, I’m told.’</p>

<p>‘Mr. Hartopp, sir? Oh no, sir, I never knew
him drink anything, sir, nor smoke neither.
Drink and tobacco he says are ... some funny
word, painkillers sort of, to keep the workin’
classes from yellin’ out while they’re bein’ skinned
alive. He’s a very funny man, sir, always makin’
jokes. Not but what he’s fond of good livin’ too,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
sir. When trade was good one time he used to
go regular every day and lunch at the Carlton.
I only found out by chance; I was that surprised.
Up till then I’d always took him for a
Socialist.’</p>

<p>‘How did he lose his leg?’</p>

<p>‘His leg, sir? I really don’t remember how
that was. It wasn’t very long ago, I know.
Blind men often get knocked about like in the
traffic.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXI</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Dwala</span> left his valet abruptly and spent many
hours walking up and down the picture-gallery,
deep in thought. Some of his slow ideas were
coming suddenly to maturity.</p>

<p>Men—these strange wild beasts that lived
wholly in a delirium of invented characters,
assigning fantastic attributes to one another and
acting solemn plays where everything was real—blood,
knives, and misery—everything but the
characters themselves—had thrust on him the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
strangest mask of all; they had made him great.
And now, at the touch of one small hand on the
lever, all the machinery of the theatre was in
motion to make him greater still, with the
greatest greatness of all—for so to his rude mind,
unskilled in the abstract mystery of Royalty,
seemed political greatness, the power of ordering
men’s days and nights.</p>

<p>Himself, he was nothing—nothing to anyone
but himself; for others he was a suit of irrelevant
attributes; no one cared what he thought or felt
or was; his Ego had no place in their scheme.
He had been always the same; and all his differences
were of human making. First Man clapped
on him the attribute of Monkey, and purposed
putting him in a cage and offering him for an
entertainment. Then Man clapped God, King,
Prisoner, and Millionaire on him in quick succession;
now they were preparing Statesman for him
to wear. Empty garments all of them, by the
very essence of things: Nature makes no Gods,
Kings, Prisoners, Millionaires or Statesmen. All
fanciful unsubstantialities of men, real only in
their effect on men, as laws of gravity are real<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
only in the eagerness of little things to be impelled;
empty shells, inhabited by irrelevant I’s
that live in corners of them, apart and unconsidered;
vacancies, chosen at random for a
centre of genuflexions, services, obediences, gold,
velvet, paper, and different sorts of food. A wise
Providence has ordained that Man’s eyes should
be blind to the vision of real naked Nature-given
personality: were it suddenly otherwise, the long-wrought
classifications of the ages would disappear
at once in a confusion of particular differences;
all leadership and direction would be lost; just as
Science would shiver to a heap of individual facts
if she were robbed of her slow-built generalisations.</p>

<p>Dwala saw that he could never merely put
aside his mask and say, Behold me as I am.
Such revelations are unthinkable to the human
mind: one might as well say, Behold me, for I
have disappeared. He could renounce Statesman
if he liked, stay Millionaire, go back to God or
King or Monkey; but until he went away from
men, and hid himself in the wild forest, he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
never be plain self again: he must inhabit either
a palace, or a temple, or a cage.</p>

<p>What was he going to do, he asked himself,
in this new mask that Man was preparing for him
with so much labour? The answer was evident;
Lady Wyse knew it too. He was making a Joke,
a big slow Joke; men were rolling it painfully up
the board for him, panting and groaning, and
when it reached the top he would tip it lightly
over and see it fall with a crash like a falling
mountain. Surely that would make him laugh?</p>

<p>And after? Well, that was a little matter.
They would kill him, perhaps; he would die
laughing at them, laughing in their angry shame-lit
faces as they stabbed him. More probably
they would let him go. They would hardly
exhibit him in Earl’s Court: ‘Pithecanthropus
erectus, ex-Cabinet Minister.’ He would get
back to the woods of Borneo again, and laugh
among the trees. In any case, he would have had
his Joke.</p>

<p>Meanwhile other attributes had been laid on
him for which he had no use: power to demand
a million little satisfactions, gross and fine, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
which he had no taste. Space to sleep and wake,
food enough to nourish him—that was all he
wanted till the great Joke reached the tumbling
point. A thousand minor jokes would crop up
by the way in the endless inequality of masks:
jokes too slender for his own handling. Must
all this go to waste? Why not enjoy by proxy?
To his large mind it was indifferent <i>who</i> was the
agent of enjoyment: himself or another, as they
had the fitter talent. Therefore he had long
been vaguely seeking someone who could replace
him in the present; an ambassador in the courts
of luxury; someone vivid, eager, strong and discontented,
some Enemy of the World, who could
exploit for him the minor meannesses of men, a
preparatory humiliation, a handy touchstone for
everyday use. Surely Hartopp was the man?</p>

<p>Dwala went with a candle in the middle of the
night to his valet’s bedroom and awoke him from
uneasy sleep.</p>

<p>‘I’ve made up my mind I must know this Mr.
Hartopp, Prosser.’</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid you mightn’t like him if you saw
him, sir,’ said the valet, sitting up in his night-cap,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
with hollow eyes, as of one rescued only for
a while from some fear to which he must return
anon.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know. We’ll go and look for him
to-morrow. You know where he lives?’</p>

<p>‘Whereabouts, sir. Somewhere off Shaftesbury
Avenue.’</p>

<p>‘All right. We’ll go and look him up to-morrow.
That’ll be rippin’. Good-night.’</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">XXII</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Neglecting</span> his engagements and Huxtable’s
remonstrances Dwala sought Hartopp for many
days in vain. With Prosser at his side he visited
the places where children play, open spaces,
archipelagos of pavement, washed by the roaring
traffic of St. Giles’s: for it was among the children
that Prosser gave most hope of finding him.</p>

<p>‘It’s one of his curious ways, bein’ with
children, sir; his dram-drinkin’ he calls it. He’s
goin’ to raise a Revolution of the children one of
these days, he says. He don’t set much store by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
the grown-ups: over-civilised he says they are,
while the children are all young savages.’</p>

<p>Hartopp had risen to lofty heights in Prosser’s
estimation, since he had realised Dwala’s plans
about him; he was a Socrates now, whose every
saying had a strange new value in remembrance.</p>

<p>At last they found him. They were standing
one sunny summer day in Shaftesbury Avenue,
when Prosser cried:</p>

<p>‘There he is!’</p>

<p>A throng of tiny Bacchanals came skipping
and whooping out of Endell Street, and in their
midst the old Silenus, clumping and swinging
jovially along. It was a gay chatter of question
and answer, gibe and repartee, flying to and from
Silenus to the nymphs, while laughter flickered
here and there at random.</p>

<p>They crossed the broad roadway in open
defiance of the traffic, and landed on the island
where Dwala stood.</p>

<p>‘Five o’clock!’ cried the old Fence as St.
Giles’s clock rang out: ‘time you were home for
your teas!’ He grinned, and fumbled in his big
yellow pocket. ‘What are you waiting for, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
little animals? Your mothers are all drunk by
now, and you’ll get what for if you’re late....
Scramble!’ he shouted, suddenly flinging a handful
of pink sweatmeats up in the sunshine and
down in the dirt, while the children wallowed and
fought with cries of joy.</p>

<p>‘Here’s two toffs,’ said one of the knot of
elders, drawing off as Dwala and Prosser
approached.</p>

<p>‘Mr. Hartopp,’ murmured Prosser, touching
his hat.</p>

<p>‘Aha, my sentimental friend, are you there?
I smell you. What’s the news? Have you
brought something sweet in chiffon for your
darling little daughter to drive in to the Opera
to-night?’</p>

<p>‘Hoping you’ll excuse me, Mr. Hartopp, I’ve
brought Prince Dwala, my employer, who was
anxious to see you.’</p>

<p>‘Oho! the “kind master.” Come to see how
the “pooah” live, my Lord?’</p>

<p>‘I’ve come to ask if you won’t come and live
with me.’</p>

<p>‘Live with you, d—— you?’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>‘Yes, live with me, at home.’</p>

<p>‘Why?’</p>

<p>‘Because I like you.’</p>

<p>‘The h—— you do! Why?’</p>

<p>‘Because I believe you’re what’s called a
“blackguard.”’</p>

<p>‘What’s this feller you’ve got hold of,
Prosser? Is he a detective, or a philanthropist,
or a lunatic?’</p>

<p>‘He’s what’s called an “eccentric” I believe,
Mr. Hartopp.’</p>

<p>‘Where do you live?’ asked the Fence
abruptly.</p>

<p>‘Park Lane,’ answered Dwala.</p>

<p>The Fence whistled.</p>

<p>‘What number?’</p>

<p>‘Number —.’</p>

<p>‘Number —?... I’ve got the plans of that
somewhere. What’s the plate like, Prosser?’</p>

<p>‘Very handy, Mr. Hartopp,’ answered the
valet, falling into old tracks of thought.</p>

<p>‘It’s beautiful plate,’ said Dwala: ‘all the
most expensive kinds. You’d have it on the
table every day at meals if you came and lived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
with me, Mr. Hartopp: of course you wouldn’t
see it, because you’re blind, but you’d know it was
there. It’s a lovely house altogether, I believe:
everything’s as expensive as we could get anywhere;
there are five footmen, and heaven only
knows how many housemaids. What I’m looking
for is somebody who’d really enjoy all these
things. I can’t. It’s such a pity you’re blind,
because you’ll miss a lot; in fact, I had half a
mind not to ask you, because you were blind.
But I was so awfully fetched by the way you
threw those sweetmeats to the children.’</p>

<p>‘You’re another d——d sentimentalist, I see.
Does he drink too, Prosser?’</p>

<p>‘No, I don’t drink,’ said Dwala: ‘I have so
many other amusements.’</p>

<p>‘What’s your income?’</p>

<p>‘Four hundred thousand pounds a year.’</p>

<p>‘Four hun.... Good Lord! you ought to be
ashamed of yourself.... Here, Thomas, Andy—anybody
there?’ he cried out, hobbling excitedly
towards the iron seats.</p>

<p>‘I’m here, Bill!’ came a voice from the distance.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>‘All right, I don’t want you.’ He hobbled
back again, and blew three calls on a dog-whistle
which hung from his neck. ‘I’ll call Joey.’
Joey came frisking up from nowhere, as dirty as
mud could make her.</p>

<p>She turned formal at once on seeing the ‘nobs,’
and put out her tongue at Prosser.</p>

<p>‘Joey, old girl, you see these two d——d
fools here? One of ’em’s a Prince of ancient
lineage.’</p>

<p>‘What, that great big ugly bloke?’</p>

<p>‘With four hundred thousand pounds a
year!’</p>

<p>‘Lor’!’ said Joey, politely.</p>

<p>‘Borrow a hanky from some nice little girl
and prepare for hysterics, for the other one’s your
long-lost father!’</p>

<p>‘He drinks,’ said Joey, edging away.</p>

<p>Hartopp laughed. ‘It’s wonderful what a lot
these children know. Now look here, Joey....
Joey’s included, of course?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, Joey’s included,’ answered Dwala.</p>

<p>‘You wouldn’t like to be a real lady, would
you, Joey?’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>‘Wouldn’t I!’ said Joey, shyly but decisively.</p>

<p>‘What! Be a rotten West-End kid?’</p>

<p>Joey giggled an affirmative.</p>

<p>‘Wash every day?’ Another giggle.</p>

<p>‘Ain’t she sweet?’ murmured Prosser.</p>

<p>A sudden idea flashed over Joey’s face.</p>

<p>‘With him about?’ she asked.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I’d be about, Joey,’ said Prosser.</p>

<p>Without a moment’s hesitation Joey fled
through the traffic and down St. Martin’s
Lane.</p>

<p>‘Well?’ said Dwala: ‘what’s your decision,
Mr. Hartopp?’</p>

<p>‘Go to h——!’ said the blind man, hobbling
resolutely away. The Prince and Prosser, after
standing a little longer, turned and went sadly
home again.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">XXIII</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> Dwala and Huxtable were sitting at breakfast
one morning, a week later, the butler leaned down
in his gentle fatherly way over the Prince’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
shoulder, and told him that a man had been asking
for him.</p>

<p>‘A blind man, sir, with a little girl with him;
very respectable. They came about half-past
seven.’</p>

<p>‘Where are they?’</p>

<p>‘They went away again, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Did they say if they were coming back?’</p>

<p>‘Not a word, sir; they just turned round and
went into the Park when they heard you wasn’t
up.’</p>

<p>Dwala then propounded at length to Huxtable
all his ideas about Hartopp and Joey. Huxtable
listened quietly, with an occasional colourless:
‘Quite so, quite so.’ He retired to his room after
breakfast, and walked up and down a great deal.
His ideas cleared after some hours of perambulation.
He arrived at the same conclusion as
Prosser. Prince Dwala was an eccentric. He
thought over the cases of a number of peers and
millionaires he knew about who had been eccentric,
and suddenly realised that eccentricity was
more than respectable; it was <i>chic</i>: it belonged
to the grandest school of behaviour. It was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
what he had expected in coming to Prince
Dwala; his own part would be difficult and call
for care. It was like the Boer War; that had
been eccentric too; but for that very reason it
had been the making of his cousin Jim, who was
now in command of a brigade. When he came
down to luncheon he looked at Dwala with an
interest almost tender.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Hartopp and Joey had not come
back. Dwala had been out into Park Lane three
or four times in the course of the morning, looking
vainly up and down for them. There was
only a patient four-wheeled cab, with two big
new leather trunks on it, standing a little way
off the gate; the driver opened his eyes heavily
each time Dwala emerged, and then returned to
sleep.</p>

<p>It was one of those solemn summer days which
visit London like dreams: one of those days when
Hyde Park, with its smooth lawns and ancient
dignity of trees, seems like the revelation of a
purpose in this fantastic world—a purpose to
which the surface of aristocratic life, with its
carriages and frocks and parasols, seems so well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
attuned, that one is convinced that the whole mass
of it must needs be as respectable as Nature.</p>

<p>They came at last: Dwala was on the steps
to meet them: Hartopp in a well-brushed black
tail coat; Joey looking ugly in a tight velvet
frock and feathered hat, her hair drawn back into
a pig-tail, all clean but her hands.</p>

<p>They both looked tired and saddened. Dwala
felt a sudden disillusion, a reduction of something
big to small dimensions.</p>

<p>‘Is that your cab outside?’ he asked.</p>

<p>Joey nodded. ‘But we’ve not decided yet.
We’ve only come to have a look.’</p>

<p>She ran up the steps, and stopped, peering
into the dark entry, awed by the motionless forms
of the big footmen.</p>

<p>They went all over the house with Dwala,
from bottom to top, conscientiously, doggedly,
examining everything. Joey insisted: Hartopp
followed, mumbling morosely. Joey listened to
all explanations with that air of undue, almost
effusive, attentiveness, which marches so nearly
with boredom. They saw Huxtable once on a
landing: he was passing from one room to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
another, in spectacles, with a bundle of papers;
he always wore spectacles till tea-time. He looked
at them drily, externally, as one looks at events
in another family.</p>

<p>A kind of depression, a melancholy hush,
weighed on the whole house and household, as if
someone had just died. One thing only was
certain: they all knew that the pretence of a probation
was an empty one; Hartopp and Joey had
come to stay.</p>

<p>Hartopp was aware of this, and wondered at
his own blank listlessness. The Enemy of Society
felt suddenly as a wild bull might, which had
spent a long hot day goring a big cathedral and
was now being led quietly to a pew. There is a
magic in our masquerading: it is with deep feelings
of solemnity that man shuffles off one disguise
and gets into another; the fraudulent company-promoter,
growing rich, enters upon his fortune
almost with the same ennobling awe as a young
girl going to her Confirmation.</p>

<p>Hartopp made an effort: he stopped Dwala
as they went downstairs.</p>

<p>‘Let’s understand one another clearly, Prince<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
What’s-your-name. If I come, I come as a free
man: Joey too. We come as gentry, or we don’t
come at all. The servants are to treat us with
respect as such. Do you see?’</p>

<p>‘Of course, of course.’</p>

<p>‘We’ll have the best of everything: eat what
we like, drink what we like, spend as much money
as we like. Do you see? No d——d philanthropy.’</p>

<p>‘I promise you solemnly.’</p>

<p>‘That’s right.’</p>

<p>The cabman was paid off and the boxes were
brought in.</p>

<p>‘Both Joey’s,’ said Hartopp: ‘I’ve brought
nothing.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll have a fire in my bedroom, please,’ said
Joey.</p>

<p>Huxtable came in at tea-time and recounted
three amusing anecdotes, at which Joey stared
in awe and the old man chuckled faintly. The
butler inquired if the young lady would like a
maid to unpack her boxes. Joey declined: she
would do it herself.</p>

<p>She went out primly after tea, to see to it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
jangling keys on a string. Huxtable went back
to some mysterious ‘work.’</p>

<p>Then the air cleared suddenly. The blind
man unbent with a touch of humour. It is humour
that keeps the door in the wall through which
alone we may hope to peep into our neighbour’s
garden. We have passed that ivy-grown, impenetrable
portal a thousand times, when suddenly
one day we find it open, and instead
of a dog growling in an arid patch of weeds,
we find a friendly neighbour grinning in our
face.</p>

<p>‘Do you know what’s in those boxes?’ said
Hartopp confidentially.</p>

<p>‘No; what?’</p>

<p>‘Wood pavement.’ He exploded with
laughter. ‘Her things weren’t fit to bring, but
she wouldn’t be seen arriving without luggage;
so she put that in to weight them down. That’s
what the fire’s for. She’ll keep ’em locked till
she’s got it all burnt—a little day by day. Don’t
let her know I told you.’</p>

<p>It was a great nuisance, Dwala said, he had
to go out that evening. Huxtable must entertain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
them. As for himself, he was dining with
Lady Wyse.</p>

<p>‘Is Lady Wyse a friend of yours?’</p>

<p>‘A great friend.’</p>

<p>‘The one whose name’s always in the paper?’</p>

<p>‘I suppose so.’</p>

<p>‘Well, take my advice and don’t let Joey know.’</p>

<p>‘Why not?’</p>

<p>‘She’d look down on you.’</p>

<p>‘Why? Lady Wyse is a very charming
woman.’</p>

<p>‘You say that because you’re a toff. She’d
hear a very different name, if she came down
our street. I’d tell her straight myself.’</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">XXIV</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was quite a small party at Lady Wyse’s.
Disturnal was there, the rising young High
Church M.P.; Sir Peter Parchmin; his wife, and
a few miscellaneous ladies; General Wapshot; a
Man with a Clever Face; an Eminent Scientist;
and a Philosopher. This last was not a speaking
character; a little wizened man with a bald<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
head; he had made a reputation in his youth by
retiring into solitude for three years and coming
back with the apophthegm, ‘Give me a pebble
and a protoplasm and I will make you a universe.’
Nobody having given him either, his plans had
rested there. They put him in a Chair at
Cambridge, and he had never opened his mouth
since. He and the Eminent Scientist were men
with that peculiar knack the learned have of
looking out of place in any clothes they wear, but
convincing you somehow that they would look
more out of place without them. Lady Wyse
had invited them quite at random, because she
thought they would be interested in a scientific
scheme which Sir Peter was to propound that
night; she could not surely be expected to
distinguish different sorts of savants?</p>

<p>Lady Parchmin was a tired but talkative
blonde, who made one feel sorry for Sir Peter in
a kind of abstract way; yet she was a saint,
and he was an immoral man. He pretended to
pursue Lady Wyse from mean and interested
motives; but there he lied. His love for Lady
Wyse was the only genuine sentiment he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
ever felt—that was why she tolerated him; she
was a strong ennobling thought, like Wagner
music remembered or imagined in a railway train;
his wife, the eternal passenger who sat before him,
dim and dowdy, on the other seat, was only a monument
of dull duty and a long-forgotten fancy.</p>

<p>Dinner was drawing to a close. Wine and
fruit were going round; the butler had marched
his squad away.</p>

<p>The Man with the Clever Face suddenly distinguished
himself—Lady Wyse had introduced
him as ‘the well-known Mr. Holmes,’ but neither
Disturnal nor the General nor the Eminent
Scientist remembered to have heard of him before.
Lady Parchmin had been recounting her emotions
on seeing a newspaper placard as she drove to
dinner.</p>

<p>‘“There,” said I when I saw it, “I’m sure it’s
the man I saw them arresting this morning.”’</p>

<p>Mr. Holmes broke silence for the first time.
He fixed his penetrating gaze on Lady Parchmin’s
hair, and said:</p>

<p>‘You must have said that to yourself then,
for you drove here alone.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>She put her hands up quickly to her head,
saying:</p>

<p>‘Good Heavens! How do you know that?
I did. Peter walked.’</p>

<p>‘How extraordinary!’ murmured the guests.</p>

<p>‘Do tell me how you told?’ said Lady
Parchmin.</p>

<p>Mr. Holmes looked round the table with a
dry, triumphant smile; then leaned confidentially
towards Lady Parchmin, and explained:</p>

<p>‘I saw your husband’s goloshes in the hall.’</p>

<p>‘You must be a detective!’ said Lady
Parchmin.</p>

<p>‘I am,’ he said.</p>

<p>‘How funny!’</p>

<p>‘Odd thing to meet at dinner, isn’t it?’ said
their hostess languidly. ‘Now then, Sir Peter,
out with your little scheme.’</p>

<p>Sir Peter cleared his throat and rearranged
his wine-glasses. He looked at Dwala.</p>

<p>‘I think you were present, Prince, at an evening
at Lady Lillico’s, where I was made to deliver a
little lecture on the Missing Link?’</p>

<p>Dwala looked steadily into the Biologist’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
eyes: he saw nothing there but an enterprise
and the desire to please; but he was conscious of
a secret triumph of amusement emanating from
Lady Wyse.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I was there.’</p>

<p>‘I mentioned, if you remember, a scheme for
an expedition?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, to find the Missing Link.’</p>

<p>‘Quite so. Well, our plan is this—I’m
empowered to speak for the University—the
new writ is issued, and we can proceed to nomination
at any moment. Now, of course, we don’t
<i>sell</i> our nomination; you quite understand
that?’</p>

<p>Mr. Disturnal caught his roving eye, and
nodded brightly.</p>

<p>‘But we’re determined to have a scientific
man, or a man interested in science. The University
is delighted to accept you; but you must
prove your interest in science in the way that
they select. Well, they’ve selected a way, and if
you accept their conditions, you’ll be nominated
on Saturday, which is the same thing with us as
being elected.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>‘What’s the condition?’ asked Dwala.</p>

<p>‘That you guarantee the Missing Link Search
Fund by handing in a cheque for 50,000<i>l.</i>, the
balance, if any, to be returned when the search is
over. Mr. Holmes here is going out to Borneo
in charge of the expedition; and a scientist or
two will go with him. Do you accept?’</p>

<p>Dwala glanced at Lady Wyse.</p>

<p>‘Certainly. I’ll send you the cheque to-night.’</p>

<p>‘And what do you propose to do with the
Missing Link when you’ve got him?’ asked Mr.
Disturnal.</p>

<p>‘Ah!’ said the Biologist, consulting the
eye of the Eminent Scientist: ‘that’s a big
question.’</p>

<p>‘Can’t you imagine,’ said Lady Wyse, ‘what
a scientist would do with a strange animal?’</p>

<p>‘I’d put him in a bag and drown him, by
Gad!’ said the General genially.</p>

<p>‘Ah, you’re not a scientist, General,’ said
Lady Wyse. ‘Sir Peter would thank Providence
humbly for his opportunities, and set about
studying the creature’s soul. Can’t you imagine
him walking politely round it asking questions?’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>‘Lady Wyse is joking, of course,’ said the
Biologist. ‘If I got hold of the animal, I know
perfectly well what I should do.’</p>

<p>‘What’s that?’ asked Mr. Disturnal, in his
bright, intellectual way.</p>

<p>‘I should examine his hippocampus minor.’</p>

<p>‘Well, really!’ said Lady Wyse, pushing back
her chair: ‘we women had better be going.’</p>

<p>‘It’s a curve in the brain,’ almost shouted Sir
Peter, hurrying to the door handle: ‘the thing
Owen and Huxley fell out about.’</p>

<p>‘Bring the men up quick,’ said Lady Wyse.
‘I and your wife’ll have nothing to talk about
upstairs but you, and we’ll both be bored to
death.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. Holmes, who went early, had a great
send-off; he was going straight to Plymouth
that night to superintend the preparation for the
expedition, which had only awaited Dwala’s
promise. Sir Peter Parchmin made a speech,
and Mr. Holmes made a speech, and everybody
waved handkerchiefs on the balcony as he drove
away.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>‘Well,’ said Lady Wyse, as Dwala sat down
beside her at last: ‘what do you think of my
little joke?’</p>

<p>‘It’s too human.’</p>

<p>‘I thought you’d be amused.’</p>

<p>‘It takes a great deal to make me laugh.’</p>

<p>‘Are you afraid people will discover your
secret?’</p>

<p>‘I think you’re rash.’</p>

<p>‘I’m not. I’m calculating. Arrived where
you are, you could sit all day on a churchyard
wall yelling your secret in people’s ears, and they
would pay no attention to it.’</p>

<p>‘Unless an honest man came by, or a clever
one.’</p>

<p>‘An honest man wouldn’t be clever enough
to hear it, and a clever one wouldn’t be honest
enough to repeat it.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t endanger a joke for the sake of a ...
an epigram.’</p>

<p>‘Do you know, Prince, I have a sort of
presentiment our joke will never come off.’</p>

<p>‘Shall I never have a good laugh before I
die?’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>‘Who knows? Something may turn up....
But why do you cough like that? Are you ill?’</p>

<p>‘No. I often cough like that.’</p>

<p>‘It would spoil everything if you were ill.’</p>

<p>With a little gesture Lady Wyse summoned
the watchful Parchmin, and bade him bring his
fellow-savants.</p>

<p>‘What’s the matter with Prince Dwala?’ she
asked. ‘He coughs in a funny way. Examine
him.’</p>

<p>The command covered the whole trio. The
Philosopher assumed a frivolous look. The
Eminent Scientist disclaimed competence: he
was Chemistry or something.</p>

<p>‘Nonsense!’ said Lady Wyse. ‘What’s the
good of being a scientist?’</p>

<p>Dwala towered serenely while the Biologist
and the Eminent Scientist—having exchanged
grimaces of apology—walked round and round
him, with their ears to his sides, one behind the
other, as if it were a game, with an occasional
murmur from the Biologist of ‘Cough again’—‘Say
ninety-nine.’</p>

<p>The little bald Philosopher stood opposite,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
with his eyebrows raised and his hands behind
his back, tipping himself patiently up and
down on his toes, like a half-witted child. The
Biologist, meeting the Eminent Scientist accidentally
at a corner, made a parenthesis of his
mouth and shook his head. Coming to the
perpendicular soon, he recommended care and a
healthy life.</p>

<p>‘Do you think there’s anything the matter with
the Prince?’ Lady Wyse asked Parchmin, aside.</p>

<p>‘I couldn’t say,’ said the Biologist. ‘I should
like to examine him properly first.’</p>

<p>‘How properly?’</p>

<p>‘One can’t tell anything through a shirt-front.’</p>

<p>‘Take him in there,’ she commanded, pointing
to the door of the next room, ‘and examine him
<i>thoroughly</i>.’</p>

<p>Dwala hesitated. ‘Isn’t he ... clever?’ he
murmured.</p>

<p>‘It’s all right,’ she smiled back; ‘he isn’t
honest.’</p>

<p>A few minutes later, when the guests were
gathering about Lady Wyse to say good-bye,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
the door of the side-room burst open, and Sir
Peter Parchmin came tumbling out, white with
horror. He seized the General, who was nearest
to him, in a wild embrace—half as a leaning-post,
half as a protection—crying:</p>

<p>‘Good Lord! He’s got a ta ... ta ...
ta....’</p>

<p>‘Confound you, sir!’ said the General; ‘do
you take me for Lady Parchmin?’</p>

<p>The Biologist only clung the closer, babbling
feebly in his ear:</p>

<p>‘He’s got a ta ... ta ... tail!’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was true. Dwala had a tail. Now I am
aware that in these days of learning, when many
an ordinary College Don knows as much science
as the elder Pliny, this will seem almost incredible;
and in the eyes of some it will throw
doubt on the truth of my story, for it is well
known that the anthropoid apes have no tails.
But then Dwala was not an anthropoid ape, but
a Missing Link. The fact is that in the old
times there were as many varieties of <i>Pithecanthropus
erectus</i> as there are nowadays of <i>Homo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
sapiens britannicus</i>; but the physical differences
between them were far more clearly marked than
ours. The aristocracy of the race, to which
Dwala’s family belonged, were distinguished from
the plebeians, not merely by the greater stoutness
of their bony structure and the superior coarseness
of their fur—distinctions which a demagogue
might have argued down to nothing—but also
by the possession of tails, a thing about which
there could be no mistake. Among the lower
classes even the merest stump, the flattering
evidence of an old scandal, entitled the owner to
a certain measure of respect.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>‘Confound his tail!’ exclaimed the peppery
General, pushing him away. ‘Who’s got a tail?
the dog?’</p>

<p>‘Dog?’ murmured the Biologist, in the dazed,
indignant tones of a man under the influence
of a drug. ‘No! Prince Dwala!’</p>

<p>The General dropped rigid into an armchair,
and bobbed up and down on the springs of it.
A shocked silence fell on the room, as if something
grossly indelicate had been shouted out.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
Men blinked and lowered their heads; women
stared and raised them. There was a movement
as of looking for things lost, an untranslated
impulse towards the stairs.</p>

<p>Lady Wyse, the one thing alive in this wax-work
show, went quickly to the door and put her
back against it, hand on handle, to prevent the
figures from escaping.</p>

<p>‘Sir Peter is talking like an idiot,’ she said,
in low, clear tones; ‘he knows perfectly well
that Prince Dwala no more has a tail than any
one of <i>us</i> has.’</p>

<p>The horror of the fact suggested passed
directly into indignation at the suggestion of it.
They turned on the Biologist, demanding an explanation.
The little General voiced the public
feeling. He shot up out of his chair, and shook
the tall savant violently by the lappels of his
coat.</p>

<p>‘Have you been drinking, sir? Do you
know that there are ladies present?’</p>

<p>A chorus of inarticulate wrath went up.
They crowded scowling round the frightened
Parchmin, women with folded arms, men with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
their hands thrust deep down into their trouser
pockets.</p>

<p>‘Now then sir, explain yourself!’ said the
General; ‘what do you mean by a tail?’</p>

<p>‘Da ... da ... did I say a tail?’</p>

<p>The General shook him again. ‘You know
you did!’</p>

<p>‘I ... I ... I ... I didn’t mean a tail,’
stammered the Biologist; ‘not in the ordinary
sense....’</p>

<p>‘You said <i>tail</i>, sir!’</p>

<p>‘I didn’t mean an ... an ... an actual
prolongation of the caudal vertebrae.’</p>

<p>‘Well, what did you mean, then?’</p>

<p>‘I only meant he had....’</p>

<p>‘Go on.’</p>

<p>‘I thought I detected....’</p>

<p>‘Go on—go on.’</p>

<p>‘That if the Prince wasn’t careful ... there
was a sort of incipient hardening of the skin
which might lead to what German doctors call
a “tail.” It’s a purely technical term. I ...
I ... apologise, I’m sure, for having spoken
inadvertently.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>‘He ought to be ashamed of himself!’ was
the general verdict.</p>

<p>‘What a dreadful thing to happen at a dinner-party!’</p>

<p>‘At Lady Wyse’s too, of all places!’</p>

<p>They all turned their backs on him, and
crowded round Dwala, who emerged serenely at
this moment from the next room; shaking hands
warmly with him, as if he had just achieved a
triumph. Mr. Disturnal smiled him a meaning
smile as he said good-bye.</p>

<p>Dwala and the Biologist were the last to go.</p>

<p>‘Good-bye,’ said Lady Wyse to Sir Peter.
‘I suppose you’ll stop the Expedition now?’</p>

<p>‘Stop the Expedition? Why?’</p>

<p>‘Great heavens! Then you haven’t guessed
the secret after all?’</p>

<p>The Biologist stared at her with wild eyes for
several seconds, then suddenly twirled and fell
like a sack on the floor. When they had bathed
him back to his senses at last, he sat up on his
hands and said:</p>

<p>‘Prince Dwala must blow his brains out!’</p>

<p>Lady Wyse rang laughter like a bell.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>‘Why?’ asked Dwala, greatly interested.</p>

<p>‘Any English gentleman would.’</p>

<p>‘I forbid it!’ said Lady Wyse.</p>

<p>‘Why?’</p>

<p>‘He’d spoil his hippocampus minor.’</p>

<p>‘Pah!’ exploded Sir Peter bitterly: ‘you
always take his side.’</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">XXV</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Arrived</span> in his own hall, Dwala became aware of
a faint shrill voice talking rapidly and jerkily,
accompanied by an even whirring noise. He
opened the library door. The room was lighted
brilliantly. To the left sat Hartopp, in evening
dress, in a big armchair, with his leg on another
chair; a champagne bottle and glasses were on
a table beside him; he was smoking a fat cigar,
and grinning as he listened. Below him, sitting
on the floor, with her pale face thrown back
against the chair, was Joey fast asleep. In the
middle of the room sat Huxtable, serious and
concentrated, managing the gramophone: one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
hand hovered over it, deft, square, and muscular,
lightly adjusting some moth’s wing of a lever in
the instrument. Beyond him, in the background,
was a stout, serious, important looking man, with
his face blacked—a nigger minstrel in red and
black striped trousers, with a tiny doll’s hat
pinned on the front of his head—who rose respectfully
at Dwala’s entrance, a glass of champagne
in one hand and a banjo in the other.</p>

<p>Evidently Huxtable had been doing his best
to entertain the guests.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">XXVI</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Dwala</span> was duly elected, and took his seat in the
House of Commons.</p>

<p>This Parliament, which had come in with
loud blowing of trumpets as a truly representative
assembly, was but a poor thing after all,
the rickety child of a long line of dissipated
ancestors; a perplexity of Imperialists, Federalists,
Separatists, Food Taxers, Free Traders,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
Church Reformers, Church Defenders, Labour
Members, Irish Members, and Members frankly
representative of private aims—men who sat for
cotton, or coal, or simply beer. No Prime
Minister could have ruled the country with it.</p>

<p>The Government was in a tottering condition.
Round after round they had been so heavily
punished by the Opposition, that it was all they
could do to stand up, dizzy and defensive, to
await the knock-out blow. The Irish Party,
sated with concessions, had got altogether out of
hand, and at last gone frankly over to the other
side. O’Grady, their leader, like an elusive
knight in a game of chess, sprang here and there
about the board, attacking in two or three places
at once; while the big-wigs of the Liberal Party
sat solidly on their squares, breathing destruction
down appropriated lines. Tory Rooks and Tory
Bishops trembled every time O’Grady moved, and
pawns went down like nine-pins, sacrificed in the
hope of deferring the inevitable check-mate. The
poor Premier, designed by Nature for a life of
contemplation, marvelled at the inconsiderate
unrest of public men, and sought a decent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
opportunity of withdrawing to the urbane refinements
of private life.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, what is called ‘the business of the
country’ must be carried on. Posts worth several
thousand pounds a year cannot be left begging
for an occupant; as Ministers went under in the
attack, new Ministers must be found, not among
the jealous multitude of small-bore country squires
and city manufacturers, but among the big guns
of longer range. Dwala was eminently one of
this park. His apparition in politics had been
so sudden; the influence of his backers was so
strong; his stooping from big opportunities of
pleasure to the tedium of Parliament was so much
of a condescension, that the Party felt he had a
right to a handsome recompense. Besides, the
last vacant post could only be filled by a representative
of one of the great seats of learning.
Dwala was made President of the Board of
Education. He said nothing, he did nothing;
others talked and worked; and all agreed that he
was a great success. He was the best-informed
Minister in the Cabinet. Others acted and did
harm; he studied and did none.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXVII</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Much</span> time passed. The Government stagnated,
but the national life went on, like a river piling
its waters against the tottering dam.</p>

<p>Then came the Great Crisis in which the Prime
Minister went down. The nation was no longer
on the brink of ruin, as the ravens had so long
croaked, but in the very midst of it.</p>

<p>There is an all-powerful Guardian of Truth,
who avenges every lie. Master, not of the world,
which runs by rule, but of the Inward Meaning
of it, which is beyond the range of law; Master,
not of enterprises and institutions, but of the
living souls of things which they rudely symbolise;
as the Poet is Master, not of words and verses,
but of the thing obscurely hidden in them;
as the Musician is Master, not of notes and
harmonies, but of the soul made audible in them,
like an invisible gossamer thread revealed in
dew: He teaches by destroying. The history
of Man is the history of the Master’s contempt
for lies. The seer of the Inward Truth sings
its glory to a world of fools, who mistake his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
symbols for the Truth itself and the seer for the
Master of it, building states and religions of
the symbols; whereat the True Master laughs,
and the building tumbles, crushing men in its
ruins.</p>

<p>Ruins of lies fell upon England, crushing
those that dwelt there as they fell. England had
reverenced forms and insulted realities. With
antiquarian fervour run riotously mad, we had
thrust full-blooded, growing realities into the
shrunken and tattered livery of old forms, stifling
the life out of them; realities of Pure Ethic and
Awe of the Insoluble Secret into old liveries of
Christian dogma; realities of Anglo-Saxon gospel
of universal Freedom into liveries of insolent
insular Imperialism; realities of Democracy into
old liveries of Feudalism, raising Tailors to high
places due to sages and centaurs—summoning
Lords of the Shears and Thread to put patches
over the rents burst in the garments by the
swelling life within, when we should have torn
the old fripperies away and let the Titan loose
from his bondage.</p>

<p>England was rich in men and minds and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
money; but the different owners of them stood
face to face clutching their wealth, hissing
defiance, petrified with jealousy, while the worms
crept in and devoured it, and England starved.
Good Government costs but little; but these
men, rich in hands and brains and the plunder
of the centuries, wrangled who should pay for
Government, each preferring Anarchy to Government
at his own cost; and the foreigners coursed
over the seas and took everything but the bare
land from us; the foreigners had no need to take
that from us for our ruin, for life is not the thing
that stands still in its place, but the thing that
comes and goes, and while we boasted of our
fleet—as the paunchy brewer boasts of his cellar
full of vats—and while we boasted that no one
dared to invade our country, the pride and the
boast turned bitter on our lips, and we found
ourselves the starving masters of a sun-sucked
ash-heap.</p>

<p>So came the great Famine, punishing the lies;
men, women, and children died in their thousands;
the poor birds died also, and the dogs and the
horses—losing their long faith in the wisdom of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
imperial man. The Titan’s livery hung loose
about him; and the Lord High Tailors shook
their heads over their steak and onion, and said
that the waist needed taking in.</p>

<p>Men had not died without a struggle; there
had been riots and fighting and theft; empty
bellies had gone of their own accord through
broken windows to fill themselves with guinea
loaves, and thence to the crowded gaols to pick
oakum into ropes to hang their leaders with;
women died patiently, like overloaded horses that
fall on the climbing hill, with a last look of the
white bewildered eye entreating pardon of their
masters for having failed to drag the burden
to the top. Children died believing in their
mothers; women died believing in some God or
Fate; men died believing in nothing but the
Police.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At last the Famine abated; the ships of corn
came hurrying in. Men are men after all; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
what is the function of the Colonies if not to
forgive the senile sins of England—to overlook
the insults of the Old Dotard’s vanity, and help
him in his hour of need?</p>

<p>For England is at once Titan and Dotard.
Youth and old age, submissive strength and
tyrannous impotence—these are the two forces
which make the parallelogram of public life.
The hard old father hobbles nobly on his ebony
cane in the sunshine of the castle terrace, unwilling
to shuffle off his gout and agues and be at
peace, because he envies possession to this rugged
giant of an heir-in-tail, whom he keeps carrying
burdens, like Caliban, in the cattle yard. Happy
the day when we shall bear the old man at last,
with ceremonious countenances, to the expectant
churchyard, and pack him solemnly away in his
ancestral vault.</p>

<p>The habit of trusting in symbols instead of
realities is not easily put off. Those who have
lived in darkness cannot face the sun of truth at
once; when the castle falls they run, not to the
fields, but to the stalls and sheds. When the
vengeance of disaster comes upon a nation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
men fly instinctively from the owlish darkness of
their ruined symbols to the twilight of other
symbols.</p>

<p>Dreading above all things the multiple
solitude which hastens every way at once;
craving before all things that sureness of direction
in space which makes the intensity both
of hope and of prayer; fixing their eyes on a
personality as the distracted peasant fixes his
eyes on an image or an eikon, the crowd betake
themselves, of a sudden unanimous impulse, all
in one way, shouting the name of a saviour or a
scapegoat, clearing confusion by the embodiment
of vengeance and deliverance in limited thinkable
dimensions. They burn the witch, and clamour
round the prophet.</p>

<p>But of forty million men, who can say which
is the true prophet?</p>

<p>In times of peace the mass of men live like
fish in tanks, aware of dim shades that come and
go beyond, recking little of what is outside their
own tiny range of weed and gravel. To be great
with the mass is not to be a collection of definite
great facts, but only a constantly recurring vagueness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
‘I know his name,’ is the sum of ordinary
knowledge of great men. But with constant
repetition the name of a man or a cause takes on
an awe-inspiring, trust-compelling quality, and
the fishes cry ecstatically: ‘Napoleon!’ ‘Buller!’
‘Chamberlain!’ ‘Carter’s Little Liver Pills!’
‘Hurrah!’—and this makes fame. While the great
Poet is starving obscurely into immortality, the
crowd without is staring awestruck at the famous
Laureate’s feather-nodding coach, as it rolls him
to oblivion in St. Paul’s. Why are all these
people craning and jostling in the roadway? Is
it because they loved the Laureate’s poems? Did
he touch some chord in their hearts which the
poor Poet’s fingers were too delicate to handle?
Not a bit! They know the one man’s verses no
better than the other’s; they stand lamenting for
the Laureate simply because they have so often
heard his name.</p>

<p>And now Dwala’s was such a name. His
mind and character were still unknown, even
to journalists; but the wavering darkness of his
name had long been familiar to the fish in every
tank. For months they had read of him in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
papers and magazines: his wealth, his success,
his eccentricity, had been the talk of England.
Then he had gone into Parliament and figured
large in the comic cartoons. Others, after short
notability, had lost favour by their speeches or
their deeds; Dwala had left his reputation to
grow of itself, like a tree. They felt his largeness.
He was talked of everywhere as the capable
man of the Cabinet. A Minister, he was remarkable
even among ordinary Members as the man
who never spoke. He was the ‘strong and silent
man in a babbling age.’</p>

<p>In the hour of despair the people clamoured,
with as much reason as they usually have for such
clamouring: ‘Prince Dwala alone can save us!
Down with Glendover! Down with Whitstable!
Down with Huggins! Dwala for ever!’ The
papers talked of a new era and a new man, who
was to ‘cleanse the Augean stable’ and set Old
England on its legs again.</p>

<p>For the lobby and the drawing-room all this
had to be translated into a new language, full
of such terms as ‘popular in the House’—‘the
support of the Church Party’—‘keep things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
going’—‘able to entertain’—‘stop the mouth
of the Irish Members.’ The division of ‘politics’
from national life which such phrases indicate
does not arise from any cynicism in the ruling
classes, but from our system of government itself.
The evil begins in the polling booth, where men
are elected, not to sit for England, but to sit for
a party or for local wants. The interest of the
nation is the only interest unrepresented in the
House of Commons.</p>

<p>Deafened with the shouts of the people, afraid
to venture to his official home through the angry
crowds that filled Whitehall, the Premier tendered
his resignation, and retired—poor scapegoat—to
his gardened grange, to finish his book on
Problems of Pure Thought.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">XXVIII</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Disturnal</span> came and went with an air of genial
mystery. The cab that carried him from Lady
Wyse’s to Prince Dwala’s carried the fate of the
nation on its two wheels. He came to assure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
Dwala of the support of the powerful Catholic
Anglican party, of which he was business manager.</p>

<p>‘Of course, I’m only a layman,’ he said, with
his broad muscular clean-shaven smile; ‘but you
may take it the thing is done. The Bishop of
Windsor will have to come and see you, just as a
matter of form. He’s our President. He’s a dear
old thing; you’ll like him. You’ll only have to
give him some lunch, and pat him on the back
and send him home again. I’ve settled it all
with Lady Wyse.’</p>

<p>The Bishop came to lunch—really a ‘dear old
thing’; a crumpled and furrowed saint, with the
wise brow of a Scotch terrier, fitted for better
things than to be managed by a scheming Jesuit
like Disturnal. Dwala respected him as a man;
Huxtable as a Bishop; Hartopp as neither. The
mere title of Bishop was enough to provoke the
fury of that pewed ox. The old Fence broke in
on the respectable conversation of the lunch-table
with ribald questions and sly allusions to Lady
Wyse, and parsons, and hopes of the Archbishopric—all
of which amused him very much,
and only bewildered the good prelate, who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
no notion what he was driving at. Hartopp
soon pushed his plate away, and sat with his chin
resting on the table and his pale blind eye-balls
turned on the Bishop, chuckling to himself, like
the head of some decapitated sorcerer in the
‘Arabian Nights’ making fun of a wicked Caliph.</p>

<p>His conversational successes pleased him so
much that he grew gay and gallant when Dwala
brought up Lady Wyse herself an hour later to
his rooms to introduce her.</p>

<p>That crafty lady had prepared the way for
friendship three weeks before by sending him
‘The Doings of Thomasina,’ over which the
world was laughing—written by a lady of fashion,
and absolutely true to life, so Huxtable assured
him. It had been the delight of many evenings
when Huxtable read it aloud to him and Dwala.</p>

<p>‘If people went on like that in Seven Dials,’
he said, ‘there’d be black eyes all round, and a
lickin’ for the girl at the end of every page.’</p>

<p>But he chuckled hugely, relishing it as a light
upon the manners and customs of the nobs.</p>

<p>He had the first floor to himself now, eight
rooms in a suite. He was very strict in his sense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
of property, rushing out like an angry spider from
his lair if he heard sounds of intrusion. But this
afternoon he needed company as an outlet for the
pride of his conversational performance, and he
hobbled forth on the landing with a grin when
he heard voices on the stairs.</p>

<p>‘Ah, Lady Wyse, is it? We had some talk
about you at lunch to-day, my lady. “Lady
Wyse is an old friend of mine,” says the Bishop.
“Ha, ha,” says I; “she’s a fine woman by all
accounts.” And then I laughed, and Huxtable
up and asked the Bishop about the state of the
Parsons’ Relief Fund. “Parsons,” says I; “why
I read the Bible right through once when I
was a boy, for a bet, and the word parson isn’t
mentioned once in the whole of the book. I
suppose you hope to be Archbishop some day?”
says I. He pretended not to hear; but I wasn’t
going to let him off. “Didn’t Lady Wyse say
anything about you bein’ made Archbishop?”
I says. “Not a word,” says he. “Didn’t she
wink?” says I. “One doesn’t wink at Bishops,”
says Huxtable. “Ah,” says I; “you don’t know
Lady Wyse”; and I and the Bishop roared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
with laughter. The old man knows a thing or
two.’</p>

<p>Lady Wyse listened patiently, and charmed
the Fence outright, without exertion, by sitting
down at the piano—<i>his</i> piano, which nobody
might touch without his leave—and playing him
‘Simple Aveu’ and ‘The Song which Reached
my Heart.’ The proletariat, who abhor sentimentality
in real life, like nothing else in art.
The sound of the music drew Joey, a sad little
creature now that she saw the possible limitations
of the pleasure of wearing new hats and steaming
slowly in a motor-car round the Park. Hearing
her footstep four rooms off, while he was leaning,
full of noble emotion, over the plaintive piano,
Hartopp rushed thumping away, knocking over
little tables as he went, and cursing to himself.</p>

<p>‘Who’s that?’</p>

<p>‘It’s only me, Toppin.’</p>

<p>‘What do you want?’</p>

<p>‘I come to hear the music.’</p>

<p>‘What do you mean by comin’ in without
askin’? Have you cleaned yourself up?’</p>

<p>‘Not partic’lar.’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>‘Then clear out! I’ve got visitors. Wait
till you’re sent for.’</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">They</span> had tea in Hartopp’s room. Lord Glendover
came in to inquire after Dwala’s health,
which had been visibly failing the last few days.</p>

<p>‘We’ve cleared the last obstacle now,’ said
Lady Wyse, marching up and down the room.
‘To-morrow Dwala will step into the Premiership.
Hooray for the new Premier!’</p>

<p>She waved her cigarette triumphantly in the
air.</p>

<p>‘The Church Party practically held the
balance, don’t you see? Well, they were ready
to follow Lord Whitstable, or Huggins, or
Strafford-Leslie, or Prince Dwala. Lord Glendover,
of course, was out of it. Well, Whitstable’s
shelved: he’s incompetent, and he
knows it.’</p>

<p>‘It’s very hard on him,’ said Lord Glendover.</p>

<p>‘Still, he gets the Governorship of Australia,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
said Lady Wyse; ‘and that’s fifteen thousand or
so a year; not so bad after all. He’s responsible
for the loss of thousands of lives in Africa.’</p>

<p>‘Yes; but think of the poor beggar’s
feelings!’</p>

<p>‘Huggins’s hopes were ruined by his case
against the Red Sea Shipping Company. It
came out that his firm had been exporting arms
to the Mad Mullah.’</p>

<p>‘But quite innocently!’ said Lord Glendover.
‘He’s a business man; he didn’t know it was
against the law.’</p>

<p>‘So there was only the Prince and Strafford-Leslie
left in the running. Strafford-Leslie
offered an Episcopal Council for Church Jurisdiction;
and we ... well, we really offered
nothing.’</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">XXX</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">His</span> appointment as Prime Minister was in
the papers two days later, with a throng of
leading articles shouting Evoë!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>A spirit of busy gaiety ruled over the big
house in Park Lane; such a spirit of Bohemian
ease as comes where private theatricals are
preparing. The policy of the Empire and the
distribution of places centred there. Everything
bustled cheerfully; doors stood open; people
came and went; meals were snatched on corners
of littered tables: the servants were infected;
footmen ran up and down the stairs like school-boys;
housemaids tittered at baize-doors, and
forgot pails on landings.</p>

<p>And in the midst of it, still and listless,
sat Dwala—the new Prime Minister. Something
strange had happened; he saw the world fading
and losing interest before his eyes. What was
the thing he had looked forward to so eagerly?
A joke? What is a joke? In this new
obscurity his mind could not piece the thing
together aright. Some sort of surprise and
ridicule? No matter. He was sorry for these
pitiful actors now; there was something so futile
about all this busy scheming in a world of shades.
To show the unimportance of importance? Was
that his joke? Pooh! the joke itself was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
important enough to amuse him now; five
minutes’ fun for a Hartopp; nothing more.</p>

<p>Strange that the world should have altered
so! He had noticed something amiss with it that
day he went to Windsor to receive his appointment
as Prime Minister; an unnatural clearness,
like the clearness of a landscape before a
storm.</p>

<p>As he stood on the platform at Paddington,
looking at the crowd of pleasure-seekers—men
and women in boating-costumes—he had seen
them, not as creatures of flesh and clothes, but
as translucent wraiths, grinning and gibbering
in one another’s faces; the only real live being
there, the Guard—Odysseus playing Charon in
Hades—watchful, responsible, long-glancing down
the train, touching his hat, receiving obols from
the shades.</p>

<p>Tears came into Lady Wyse’s heart as she sat
and looked at him. She guessed the truth, which
he did not suspect; death was going to take from
her the companion-mind which had made her
wilderness green again. But that belief she put
away from herself and him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>In other things they thought together, these
two minds: his, the elemental, the slow, the
encompassing; hers, the polished, the swift, the
penetrating; his, like the thunder rolling, huge
and formless; hers, like the music of the master’s
fiddle, delicate, exact, exhaustive. Both saw
their old scheme for laughter vanish like a mirage
in the desert as the traveller approaches; and in
its place, from the heart of all things, welled up
the new thought, the greater thought, suited to
the solemn grandeur of their friendship.</p>

<p>Dwala was at a table, coughing feebly; opposite
him Huxtable, busy with ink and papers.
Lady Wyse sat talking intermittently, absently,
listlessly, with Lord Glendover by the empty
tea-cups. She rose, and strayed over to Dwala’s
table, where she stood awhile picking up papers
and throwing them down again.</p>

<p>‘What this?... “The best hundred books.”’</p>

<p>‘That’s for the prospectus of Glenister’s new
“Dwala Classics,”’ said Huxtable.</p>

<p>‘“The Bible, Shakespere, Confucius, Hi-ti-hi,
Kipling, the Q’urân, The Doings of
Thomasina” ...’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>She tore it up and threw it on the floor,
paying no heed to Huxtable. Then she picked
up another paper and read it out aloud: “I am
in favour of inducing the Colonies to put heavy
duties on all foreign goods. This will promote a
friendly feeling between England and her dependencies.”</p>

<p>‘That’s rather neat,’ said Lord Glendover.</p>

<p>‘Dull, I call it,’ said Lady Wyse.</p>

<p>‘It’s out of the draft for the new pronouncement,’
said Huxtable.</p>

<p>She took a pencil, and amended it.</p>

<p>‘“I am in favour of inducing the Colonies to
put heavy duties on one another’s goods. This
will promote a friendly feeling between England
and foreign countries.” That’s better, don’t you
think, Lord Glendover?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I think it is,’ said the noble Lord; ‘I
like that touch about “foreign countries.”’</p>

<p>Huxtable leaned forward as if about to speak;
but sank back and cracked his thumbs. She
stood biting her pencil for a little time, and then
tore the pronouncement also in pieces, and threw
it on the floor. She walked up and down, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
stopped in front of Lord Glendover, with folded
arms, and with tears standing in her eyes.</p>

<p>‘It is a pitiful, pitiful thing,’ she said; ‘you
are all so good, one is obliged to believe in the
Devil.’</p>

<p>‘That don’t hang together, you know,’ said
Lord Glendover gravely.</p>

<p>‘It is like some hideous game, where each
child has to speak a harmless word in turn, and
the whole sentence is rank blasphemy and
wickedness. Each of you goes through a foolish,
innocent routine, with a clear conscience and the
applause of the poor multitude; and the result
is misery, misery, misery. Not random misery,
here and there, such as you harmless creatures
might chance on by the way, but a fearful consistent
scheme of deeply-calculated, universal
misery—a thing of hellish contrivance, worthy of
the fiery genius of the sulphur pit. What am I,
and what is this poor Lord Glendover? Makers
and unmakers of men? Pah! We are pitiful
pawns in the awful game, dreaming we move of
our own accord only because the other pawns do
not jostle us. Why do we stay cumbering the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
board? God knows! And yet without us there
would be no game. It lies with us, it lies with
us to put an end to it.’</p>

<p>She spoke with lifted arm and ringing
voice, like a prophet of repentance; while Lord
Glendover leaned back in his low chair, looking
up over his brown clasped hands with frightened
eyes. There was something comical in this big
creature’s dependent, child-like look. Lady Wyse
smiled suddenly at him:</p>

<p>‘We must kick over the board, my little man,
and spoil the Devil’s game.’</p>

<p>The scared look spread downwards to his
mouth. He did not understand any of the words
she spoke; but a vague instinct of wisdom and
alarm shot through him, as through a baby hare,
which thought it was play, and suddenly finds
death baying on every side.</p>

<p>‘You don’t mean reconstruction, do you,
Lady Wyse? Dwala’s not going to....’</p>

<p>The awfulness was too sudden-spreading to
be crumpled back into words. She smiled
again.</p>

<p>‘Revolution, my child, revolution! We’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
make Old England stand on its head and
shout.’</p>

<p>‘Good Gad! But he’s bound to us in
honour. Dwala’s a gentleman—we look to him.
We’d never have put him up if he hadn’t been
pledged in honour. He can’t go back on us
now.’</p>

<p>‘He’s pledged to nothing, any more than I
am; any more than a ship is that you may
charter to carry a cargo of slaves to Jamaica.
And if the ship is turned round in mid-Atlantic,
and carried back to the coast of Africa, what use
is it your crying out: “You’re not a gentleman,
you ship! We trusted you, we chartered you to
carry our blacks to slavery, and here you are
taking us back to be eaten by the cannibals.”
I’m sorry for you, Lord Glendover, quite sorry
enough. You’re a good man, and not more
stupid than most. You might have been a
decent farmer, or bricklayer, or gamekeeper; but
you’ve gone along the beaten track that leads to
villainy—unconscious, irreclaimable villainy. You
don’t see it, and you never will. Go home and
be obscure. I’m sorry for you; but I’m sorrier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
for the forty million blacks that we have on
board, and now we mean to carry them back to
Africa.’</p>

<p>Lord Glendover went away, gloomy and
bewildered, feeling great national misfortunes
gathering in the air. He visited his colleagues,
and considered how the country could be
saved.</p>

<p>But salvation was not to come from Lord
Glendover.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parliament</span> was dissolved, and the Great Policy
was launched. The obscurity had been suddenly
lifted from Dwala’s mind: a hectic strength and
clearness took its place. He and Lady Wyse did
not so much invent the New Charter as discover
it: it was the revelation of a thing existent;
as they sat pen in hand the words came to
them from some far place, illuminating and
inevitable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A month</span> had passed. The General Election was
over. The great drought, the heaviness, the dull
unrest was ended. The Dragon of the myth, the
monster which slowly sucks up the waters, condemning
the land to infertility and pestilence,
was slain, and the waters gushed forth again
to fruitfulness. The myriad warriors who had
helped to pierce his flanks went coursing over the
plain, with a brandishing of spears and cries of
‘Victory!’ St. George turned in his long sleep
and opened his heavy eyes. Well did he know
those triumphing shouts. Was the race of dragons
ended now, or would a new dragon spring from
the blood of the old as heretofore?</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">XXXIII</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Success</span> is a strong wine. It was running vividly
in Dwala’s veins. Every least thing he did
seemed to him fate-ordered and conclusive. Oh,
the pride of it, the joy of it, the ease of it! The
acclamations and the consciousness of right!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>The new Civilisation was like a poem, the
scheme of which has come whole and organic to
the poet, and which germinates therefore without
constraint into its natural, necessary verses. The
right men and the right ideas fell of themselves
into their places, like particles forming a system
of crystals. Dwala had found the basic idea, which
all this turbid mass had been so long awaiting.
He created life and received it. That same life
flowed into his fibres, from the movement of the
multitude, which flows into the peasant-woman’s
baby out of the dust gathered on the busy
highway.</p>

<p>Lady Wyse, seeing the easy joyful motion of
his limbs and hearing the deep vigour of his
voice, put her presentiments away. Dwala himself
looked back in wonder at that grey mood
when the world had faded from him. He was like
the traveller who stands in the garish whirl of the
fair, wondering if this can be the place that looked
so grim on Sunday. He was enjoying the strong
rush of life which a kindly Heaven sends to the
consumptive as consolation for their early death.</p>

<p>He had new friends about him now. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
Glendovers, the Disturnals, and the rest of that
crew had vanished into the Unknown; they were
growing turnips, shooting partridges, or riding
on motor-ears somewhere in the Outer Darkness.
Hartopp and Prosser were still there; Joey had
run away to Seven Dials; Huxtable had packed
his boxes, and stayed on in a condition of provisional
irresolution.</p>

<p>On Dwala’s third floor lived an ascetic
pensioner—a certain Mr. Bone, an American, a
traveller in the East, a friend of Lady Wyse—connected
by some mystery of familiarity with
Dwala’s past. Rumour had it that he was an
adventurer who had been Dwala’s Prime Minister
in his days of sovereignty.</p>

<p>Dwala’s palace, in fact, was fast turning into
a monastery, where the Abbot, with his little cell
by the hall-door, was the least luxuriously housed
of all.</p>

<p>Prosser, as I said, was still there, but he was
no longer there as valet. The acceptance of such
personal service was inconsistent with the Prince’s
New Humanity, and Prosser was quite incapable
of performing his duties properly. For some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
time he had contented himself with a life of
ease in his own room. But <i>his</i> politics also had
changed: he did not see why he should be worse
off than Hartopp, and, by force of gradual asking,
acquired the whole of the second floor, over
Hartopp, for his portion. He had everything he
could think of wanting in his rooms; but even
that did not content him. He had thought that
wealth was all he needed to make him happy in
his sober intervals; but soon found out that
he was mistaken. His career had given him a
longing for <i>other</i> people’s property; things lost
their interest for him once they became his own.
He craved for the excitements of the past.
Scissors, and ashtrays, and other glittering things
got a way of disappearing wherever he went
about the house. One night Dwala was aroused
by the screaming of a police whistle from one of
Hartopp’s windows over him, and going up he
found the Fence sitting on Prosser’s chest in the
window-seat, and blowing for all he was worth.
A broken cupboard and a trailing jemmy explained
the situation.</p>

<p>‘All right, guvnor, I’ll go quietly,’ said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
Prosser, in a squeezed husky voice; ‘I’m nabbed
right enough this time.’ All the household
crowded in at the doorway with scared faces;
policemen appeared, and the alarm ended with
the lights being turned up and everybody sitting
down together, policemen and all, to a scratch
supper in the dining-room, and laughing uproariously,
as if something very funny had occurred.</p>

<p>The best of Prosser was that he never made
any unpleasantness about being arrested. He
would surrender at discretion to the housemaid or
the boot boy, and offer to ‘go quietly.’ The
policemen outside entered into the joke of it, and
were ready on the doorstep to come in for their
supper and half-crown whenever the episcopal
butler ran out of a night—as he always did—to
fetch them. The American was the only one
who missed the fun of the thing; he swore that
if he found anyone prowling about his rooms he
would punch his head and hand him over, bag
and baggage, to the police.</p>

<p>Dwala himself was already tired of the joke,
when the butler—rather dishevelled—came in to
the picture-gallery where he was pacing up and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
down, one afternoon, with a sheaf of spoons in
one hand and the crestfallen Prosser in the other.</p>

<p>‘Why don’t you steal something big and
have done with it?’ Dwala said, when he and
the ex-valet were left alone. ‘One of these
pictures, for instance; they’re very valuable some
of them, I know. Now here’s a tremendously
fine thing, I’m told. Who’s it by? The name’s
written on the frame.’</p>

<p>‘Rubens, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Now you take that, Prosser, some night. I
don’t want it a bit, I assure you. It’s worth
something like fifteen thousand pounds, I’m told.’</p>

<p>Prosser returned it after a couple of days.</p>

<p>‘I can’t sleep with it in the room, I can’t, sir.
When I shuts my eyes I seems to see all them
ladies rollin’ up and down and every way till I’m
fairly giddy. But I promise you, sir, I won’t go
in no more for little thievin’s, I’ll keep my eyes
open for something big.’</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">XXXIV</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Sir Peter Parchmin</span> was a rare visitor. He
disliked the company which Dwala kept; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
couldn’t get on with Mr. Cato, who was always
in and out of the house. He was growing visibly
older in the effort of keeping his countenance,
while his colleagues gloated over despatches of
the Missing Link Expedition, which kept writing
hopefully from Borneo that it was on the eve
of achieving its object; Mr. Holmes had seen
curious scratches on trees, or had heard peculiar
noises at night; once they sent home a button
which he had discovered in the forest. The
hopes of the scientific world ran high.</p>

<p>‘You must get those people to come home, Sir
Peter,’ said Dwala to the Biologist, on one of his
visits. ‘He’s a terrible fellow is that Mr. Holmes;
I shouldn’t feel safe in going back while he’s out
there. He’d have me, tail and all, in no time.’</p>

<p>‘But good heavens, dear Prince, you’re not
thinking of leaving us?’ said the Biologist.
Joyful relief soared upwards from his heart; he
had barely time to clap a distressful expression
over it to keep it from escaping.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Dwala, ‘I’m going home. I have
my own life to live, you know. I’ve been a
slave over here, working for the good of Man.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
My work is done; I have delivered my message;
and now I’m going back to my wild life in the
forest while I’m still young and strong. I mean
to ... to throw all this off’—he flapped his
coat like a bird—‘and enjoy myself.’</p>

<p>‘I trust you will be very <i>very</i> happy,’ said
the Biologist, shaking him warmly by the hand.
‘How are you going to manage about the
money?’ he asked in a lower voice.</p>

<p>‘They’re arranging it in there,’ said Dwala, in
the same precautious tones, pointing to a door,
behind which voices could be heard.</p>

<p>The door opened at that moment and
admitted an elderly obsequious man in black,
with a big parchment folded under his arm; and
behind him came Baron Blumenstrauss, Lady
Wyse, Mr. Cato, and a lean brown man with a
tuft on his chin, whom Sir Peter had seen there
once before. This man smiled at Sir Peter drily.
The obsequious man said good-bye, and shook
hands with the Prince.</p>

<p>‘It’s all right, your Royal Highness; signed,
sealed, delivered, and stamped.’</p>

<p>‘Quite sound in law, is it?’ said the Prince.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>‘Inter fifos,’ nodded the Baron; ‘sount as a pell.’</p>

<p>The obsequious gentleman hurried out.</p>

<p>‘Fonny man!’ said the Baron, patting the
Prince on the shoulder, and smiling at Sir Peter;
‘he gif his broperty all away, effery penny.’</p>

<p>‘It’s generous, dear Prince,’ said the Biologist,
‘but is it wise? Even out there, no doubt, one
has expenses.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! I sha’n’t want any money,’ said the
Prince.</p>

<p>‘They have no pockets, you know,’ said Lady
Wyse.</p>

<p>Whereupon the Baron, who was not initiated,
adjusted his glasses and looked at her with great
attention.</p>

<p>‘Remember King Lear,’ said the Biologist.
‘He divided his property in two’....</p>

<p>‘Seely fellow!’ said the Baron.</p>

<p>‘And his daughters were both ungrateful.’</p>

<p>‘Natürlich!’ said the Baron. ‘He trowed
away de chief ting he haf; he gif de broperty
widout de power. If I difide my corner in
Brazilians into two corners for de boys, do
you tink Max and Choel loff me very moch?’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>‘You would find some Cordelia, I am sure,
dear Baron.’</p>

<p>‘Nod widout monny,’ said the Baron.</p>

<p>‘There’s no Cordelia in this case,’ said Lady
Wyse; ‘I’m Goneril and the other lady all in one.’</p>

<p>‘Really?’ The Biologist was all smiles
and proffered hands. ‘I congratulate you. The
Prince couldn’t have disposed of his fortune
better, I’m sure.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! that depends how people treat us.’</p>

<p>‘Dere is gondition,’ said the Baron, looking
at his watch.</p>

<p>‘May one inquire, dear Prince, what the
condition is?’</p>

<p>‘Oh! it’s a mere nothing.’</p>

<p>‘Lady Wyse publish his “Memoirs,”’ said
the Baron.</p>

<p>The Biologist turned pale.</p>

<p>‘That reminds me,’ said the American; ‘I
mustn’t leave those papers litterin’ about. I
forgot to lock them up.’</p>

<p>‘Goot-bye,’ said the Baron. ‘I haf beesness
encagement.’ He followed the American out at
the door.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>‘Of course!’ said the Biologist, brightening.
‘“Memoirs of a Statesman”—anecdotes of the
great people you have met. Who is the
American-looking man?’</p>

<p>‘Oh! that’s Mr. Bone, one of my collaborators.
Mr. Cato and Lady Wyse are the
others; between us, you see, we cover the whole
ground. I met Mr. Bone in Borneo. In fact,
he was ... he was my proprietor. I’m going
to leave the history of my life as a legacy and a
lesson to the English Nation.’</p>

<p>‘You’ll have to go over to Borneo with the
Prince, Sir Peter,’ said Lady Wyse: ‘you’ll be
much more comfortable up one of his trees than
you will be in England.’</p>

<p>The question had been debated many and
many a time between them. Mr. Cato, as
always, was for candour; he felt that Dwala
was in a false position; he thought the secret
should be published at once, and guaranteed the
enthusiastic interest of the nation. Mr. Bone,
for other reasons, agreed with him as to immediate
publication; he thought there was money
in it. Lady Wyse was all for caution; she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
lacked the business instinct of the American,
and the optimism of Mr. Cato; she doubted the
enthusiasm of the public; she thought it was
running into unnecessary danger to publish the
secret before the Prince was out of the country.
It had therefore been agreed that she should
publish it as soon as he was safe in the great
forest again. She was ready to incur any danger
herself; she was tired of life; and she did not in
the least mind what happened to the Biologist.</p>

<p>The Biologist saw ruin impending. Savage,
reckless hatred welled in his breast as he looked
at this great creature, fatally sick, but rejoicing
in a present intensity of life and vigour. He
groped about for something sharp and venomous
to pierce him with; to make him fall beside him
into the valley of despair. He walked up to
Dwala, hissing like a serpent in his face.</p>

<p>‘You have come to Man as an apostle,
bringing us a new message of Civilisation.’</p>

<p>Dwala nodded, rather proudly.</p>

<p>‘Do you know what Man has given to you
in return? What Man always gives to such
animals? What any scientist could have told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
you you were bound to get in coming?...
Consumption.... Phthisis pulmonalis....
Death!... Going back while you’re young
and strong to your wild life in the forest! Pish!
You won’t live the month out. I knew it that
night. You’re a dying beast.’</p>

<p>Alas! why had Lady Wyse never told him?
He had never thought of that. Life hummed
and bubbled through his veins. He knew
nothing of sickness and death. He had always
been alive. The world had been faint at times;
but that was the world, not he. A stiffening
horror ran through him; he felt his skin moving
against his clothes. Then his mind ran rapidly
through all the series of events—the growth to
the full knowledge of Man, the labouring hope of
a joke, the change, the revelation, the submission
to an overwhelming truth, the rejoicing millions....
Then suddenly this discovery of an unsuspected
vengeance-for-benefit which had been
stealing slowly and surely from the first in his
steps, to spring at last on his back in the moment
of fruition.</p>

<p>It was too funny; the surprise of the inevitable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
overcame him; it was a Joke which suddenly
leaped up embracing the whole life of a created
being, and the destiny of a nation—of humanity
itself.</p>

<p>Dwala laughed. For the last time he
laughed. A laugh to which his others were
childish crowings; a laugh which flung horror on
to the walls and into the darkened air, and
spread a sudden dismay of things worse than
death throughout the land. Men stopped in
their work and in their talk and their lips grew
pale without a cause; some goodness had gone
out of Providence; some terror had been added
to Fate. From the fire of that dismay the
Biologist emerged a withered and broken man;
Mr. Cato never flinched, his sheer goodness protected
him; Lady Wyse broke into tears. She,
too, was unscathed. No human canon of ethics
has been invented by which she could be called
good; she was a breaker of laws, an enemy of her
kind. But in the place of ‘goodness’ she had a
greatness which set her above the need of it.</p>

<p>When the paroxysm of laughter was ended,
Dwala staggered and sank into a chair, and they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
saw him hanging from it with the blood streaming
out of his mouth.</p>

<p>At once they were in the world of definite,
manageable facts again. The Biologist became
the attentive practitioner, Lady Wyse the understanding
woman, Mr. Cato the bewildered layman,
busily doing unnecessary things, ringing the
bell, calling for brandy, hurrying out into the
hall to see why they were so long. Huxtable
and the American came running down the stairs,
and Dwala was carried to his room and put
to bed.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">XXXV</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">While</span> all the household radiated about Dwala’s
sick-bed, and there was no attention for any other
thing, the Biologist ran swiftly up the stairs,
guided by a superhuman instinct of despair,
straight to the American’s room. He was going
to seize the ‘Memoirs’ and burn them. Dwala was
dying; no new authentic copy could be produced
again. In the doorway he saw that his instincts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
had guided him aright. American things greeted
his eyes—an American hat on the chest of
drawers, American corn-cob pipes on the mantelpiece.
But what was this? Something alive in
the room! A man crouching behind the table
with a bundle of papers. It was Prosser ‘doing
something big’ at last. Too much astonished
to move for a moment, Sir Peter stood staring
stupidly at the frightened, cowering figure behind
the table.</p>

<p>‘Hello: what are you doin’ here?’ said a
voice in the doorway. Then the American espied
the broken desk, and a moment later the Biologist
found himself clutched by the collar, trying helplessly
to protect his head from a flailing fist,
while Prosser’s shadow shot low and horizontal
through the doorway.</p>

<p>‘The Memoirs! the Memoirs!’ yelled the
Biologist. ‘The d——d thief’s stolen the
Memoirs! Let me go! Let me go! It’s Prosser,
not me! Oh, for God’s sake, don’t hit me
again!’</p>

<p>At the mention of Prosser the American
stayed his hand, fumbled Sir Peter’s pockets,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
then snatched him by the collar, and ran down
the stairs, dragging him after him like a live thing
in a sack. But they were too slow for Prosser.
As they came out into Park Lane shouting ‘Stop
thief! stop thief!’ there was the fat policeman
saluting and grinning delightedly.</p>

<p>‘He’s got clean away this time, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Heavens alive! Why didn’t you stop him?’</p>

<p>‘I knows my place, sir’—with a wink. ‘It’s
only Mr. Prosser.’</p>

<p>‘Blow your whistle, man! Blow your whistle!
He’s stolen State Papers.’</p>

<p>The policeman walked very slowly forward
to the edge of the pavement and looked up and
down the road, then turned about, smiling rather
nervously.</p>

<p>‘Do you reely mean it, sir?’</p>

<p>‘Good Lord!’ said the American, and started
off running madly without another word into
Oxford Street; while the Biologist careered,
wild and hatless, up Grosvenor Street, yelling
desperately ‘Prosser, <i>dear</i> Prosser!’ to the
scandal of Mayfair.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXXVI</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the many unnecessary things which Mr.
Cato did in the bewilderment of Dwala’s sudden
illness, the most unnecessary was to telegraph
news of it to his sister, Lady Lillico.</p>

<p>‘Dwala ill lung hemorrhage doctors offer
little hope recovery Wyndham.’</p>

<p>They were in the drawing-room when the telegram
came, just preparing to go and dress for dinner.</p>

<p>‘How too perfectly frightful!’ cried Lady
Lillico. ‘The Premier dying! I must go at once.’</p>

<p>‘Good Lord, Louisa, what for?’ said her
husband.</p>

<p>‘Don’t be so cynical, John. If Wyndham
has telegraphed for me?’</p>

<p>‘Are you going to nurse the Prince?’</p>

<p>‘Of course I am. Pray keep your insinuations
for some more fitting time. What brutes
men are! I believe you feel <i>nothing</i> even now!’
At which she began to cry.</p>

<p>‘What about yer dinner?’</p>

<p>‘As if I could dine! Tell Hopkins to make
up a little basket of something to eat on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
way. One mustn’t give any extra trouble. Oh
dear, oh dear; and my maid’s out! I shall have
to take Emily. You must send Harper on <i>at
once</i> when she comes in.’</p>

<p>However, no feats of heroism were demanded
of Lady Lillico. She found Mr. Cato and
Huxtable waiting for her with a comfortable
meal—Lady Wyse stayed with Dwala—for
though the servants’ hall was all agog with the
events of the afternoon, and the butler darkly
prognosticated ‘the worst,’ things above stairs
were in their usual train. And when she presented
herself an hour later, almost gay with fine
emotion, in a ‘business-like costume,’ cap and
pinafore complete, in the darkened sick-room,
Lady Wyse, who hurried to the door to check her
entry—her violet eyes grown nearly black, and
looking ‘very wicked,’ as Lady Lillico said afterwards—told
her baldly that she would not be
wanted till the morning.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the sun cast his cold inquiring eye on
England in the morning, and the innocent fields<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
awoke in their grey shifts of dew, the trains that
shot North, West, and South from London over
the landscape, like worldly thoughts in a house
of prayer, bore the tidings of Dwala’s disgrace.
Trainloads of newspapers, the white wax sweated
forth by the grimy bees in the sleepless hives of
the big city, rattled past answering loads of milk
and meat, gifts of the country, making the daily
exchange. Squires and parsons were too shocked
to eat their breakfast; their wives raced against
the doctor to carry the news from house to house;
the schoolmasters told the children; the children
carried the tidings with the handkerchief of
dinner to their fathers under the trees in the
field. There was no room for hesitation; verdict
and judgment were pronounced already. The
country had been made the victim of a hideous
hoax. Dwala and all his works must perish.</p>

<p>And yet, when the Biologist blurted his hint
of a tail, a roomful of people turned and rent
him! It is the way of the world; it is part of
good manners. A partial revelation, a timid hint,
an indiscretion, is smothered ignominiously;
when the whole blatant truth brays out, men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
welcome it with ferocious joy. So, in the ancient
days, tactless young angels in Heaven were sent
to Coventry who alluded to Lucifer’s tail, or
noticed anything odd about his feet; but when
his tumbling-day came at last, the Seraphim
were in the very front of the crowd which stood
pelting meteors and yelling <i>Caudate! ungulate!</i>
down from the clouds.</p>

<p>Men shut up their shops in London and
gathered about taverns and corner-posts to unravel
the sense of the bewildering news. Public
Opinion, deserting the grass of the Parks,
slouched into the streets to learn what it must
do.</p>

<p>When Joey ran down into the street to fetch
the morning milk, the news stared out at her
from the boards in pink and black: ‘Dwala, the
Missing Link!’</p>

<p>‘Golly!’ said her pals; ‘what’s your bloke
been up to now?’</p>

<p>Joey was a heroine every day—the greatness
of her acquaintance had a savour in Seven
Dials which it had lacked in Park Lane; but
this morning she soared altogether out of sight.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
What were milk-jugs and breakfast to such a
thing as this? The milk penny went in a couple
of newspapers, and she darted off with them
across country for Dwala’s house. Who knew
but she might be the first to bring him the
great news?</p>

<p>Everybody was in the streets, as happens
when public events are astir; and every street
sent forth a thin stream that trickled in the
same direction, till it formed a full river in Park
Lane. A posse of policemen guarded the spiked
gates.</p>

<p>‘Move on! Move on!’ said the official
voice.</p>

<p>‘None of your nonsense, constable; I’m a
friend of the Missin’ Link.’</p>

<p>‘What! Miss Joey!’ beamed a familiar
face from under a helmet. ‘Let her in, Bill;
<i>she</i> won’t ’urt ’im.’</p>

<p>The steps were littered with telegrams that
lay like autumn leaves unswept; and an anxious
footman, muttering to himself, was strapping a
bag in the entry.</p>

<p>‘Is the Missin’ Link at home, young man?’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>‘The brutes! To leave me behind, all
alone!’</p>

<p>It was the last of the servants, deserted like
an unwilling Casa Bianca in the general flight,
while packing his things in his cubicle. A
moment later he had gone too, without even
looking at her, and she stood alone in the empty,
echoing hall. She could hear Hartopp cursing
and thumping with his wooden leg on the floor
above. Then a pistol-shot rang out somewhere
in the house, and she was frightened. While she
stood hesitating which way to run a door swung
to, and Lady Wyse walked across the hall, with
a basin steaming in her hands. She went in at
another door, and Joey followed her, clutching
her newspapers.</p>

<p>Dwala sat up in bed, propped against pillows,
with ghastly, hollow eyes; and on the chair
beside him was Mr. Cato, pale and dishevelled,
fast asleep. A cold wave of disappointment
surged over Joey. Was this what Missing Links
looked like? But he smiled at her, and the old
feeling of fellowship came back.</p>

<p>‘Have you heard the news?’ said Joey.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>Dwala nodded. ‘What do they say?’</p>

<p>Joey read him column on column of frantic
outcry, at all of which he smiled gently.</p>

<p>‘This is our joke,’ he said, at last, to Lady
Wyse.</p>

<p>‘It’s not our best.’</p>

<p>Then there came a tap at the door, and a
gentle voice saying:</p>

<p>‘May I come in?’</p>

<p>Lady Lillico had been awoken by a dream
with the sound of a shot in it. Nine o’clock!
Why, where was Harper? She rang, and rang
in vain. Then she looked out of window, and
smiled and nodded at the crowd. How sweet of
them to be so anxious about the poor dear Prince!
And still no Harper. Never mind! One must
expect to rough it in a house of sickness. She
knotted her hair and slipped on her dressing-gown;
a first visit in <i>déshabillé</i> lends a motherly
grace to a nurse’s part.</p>

<p>She tripped lightly down the silent stairs to
Dwala’s room.</p>

<p>‘May I come in?’</p>

<p>She tip-toed up to the bed with a ceremonious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
face. Mr. Cato frowned; Lady Wyse looked at
her with cold curiosity.</p>

<p>‘Have you heard the news?’ said Joey,
rustling a newspaper.</p>

<p>‘Evidently not,’ said Lady Wyse.</p>

<p>‘It’s all come out,’ said Mr. Cato, sepulchrally.</p>

<p>‘What’s come out?’ said his sister, scared.
‘I’ve heard nothing.’</p>

<p>Joey thrust the paper at her with an indicating
finger.</p>

<p>She stared for a long time at the words
without understanding; then fell into a chair
and laughed hysterically.</p>

<p>‘What do you think of it now they’ve caught
it?’ whispered Dwala, turning white eyes towards
her.</p>

<p>‘Well, really, you ridiculous creature!’ she
exclaimed, flapping at him with a little lace
handkerchief, half coquettishly, half as if keeping
something off. ‘It’s so out of the common....
The Prime Minister!... One doesn’t know
<i>what</i> to say!’</p>

<p>‘He’s dying,’ said Mr. Cato.</p>

<p>‘Wyndham! How can you!’</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>‘Lady Wyse must go and get some sleep now;
you will take her place.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t be idiotic! I should be no use. Oh
dear, oh dear! Where <i>can</i> Harper be?’</p>

<p>‘Sit down, Louisa!’ said Mr. Cato sternly,
barring her way. ‘Lady Wyse has been up all night.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t be so cruel.... Let me go! let me
go!’ she screamed in an access of sudden fear,
wrenched herself free from him, and ran towards
the door.</p>

<p>Then abruptly her horror leaped up and overwhelmed
her; the instinct of flying from the
incomprehensible—the instinct of the horse which
shies at a piece of moving paper—was swallowed
up in the nightmare of realising that the impossible
had happened, was in this very room
with her. This man she had come to nurse,
this man with whom she had talked and shaken
hands, was suddenly not a man, but something
unknown and monstrous, of another world. Her
faculties failed, as at sight of a ghost, not in fear
of injury, but in the mere awfulness of the alien
power. She staggered out at the door crying
‘Save me! save me!’ threw her hands forward in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
her first natural gesture since childhood, and fell
swooning in the hall. When she came back to
consciousness, after long journeying in nightmare
worlds, she heard angry voices speaking near her.</p>

<p>‘Let me out, d—— you!’ said Hartopp—that
dreadful Mr. Hartopp—‘they’re throwing stones
at my windows, I tell you. They’ll smash my
china! Let me get at the brutes!’</p>

<p>‘This door ain’t goin’ to be opened till the
Prince is re-moved.’</p>

<p>It was the American who answered him. He
stood with his hat on, leaning against the barred
and bolted hall-door, his arms folded and a pistol
drooping from either hand.</p>

<p>‘D—— the ——!’ said Hartopp. ‘Why
don’t you chuck him out and have done with it?
It’s all his fault.’</p>

<p>‘Thank God you’re back!’ said Lady Wyse’s
voice right over Lady Lillico’s head. ‘Have you
arranged it?’</p>

<p>‘The Boss is agreeable,’ said the American.
‘The “Phineas” will be at Blackwall at twelve
o’clock, steam up. One of his vans is waitin’
down back in Butlin Street now, and we must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
shift the Prince at once, before any onpleasantness
begins. There was no other way; the Prince
will hev to go as an anamal.’</p>

<p>A stone came jingling through the window
beside them, and others followed in showers.</p>

<p>‘B—— brutes!’ said the blind man.</p>

<p>‘Where’s Huxtable?’ said Lady Wyse.</p>

<p>‘Huxtable’s gone.’</p>

<p>‘Skunk!’ said Joey.</p>

<p>‘Not quite a skunk,’ said the American;
‘“skunk” is goin’ too fur.’</p>

<p>There was a roar and a rush outside, battle
cries, shrieks of despairing whistles, and a moment
later a heavy battering at the mahogany of the
front door.</p>

<p>Lady Lillico, fully conscious at last, jumped
up with piercing yells. She ran this way and
that, bewildered.</p>

<p>‘We must get the Prince away quickly,’ said
Lady Wyse, going towards his room.</p>

<p>‘Oh, let me out, let me out somewhere!’
cried Lady Lillico. Joey ran past with her
tongue thrust mockingly forth, like a heraldic
lion gardant.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>‘Here, give me your pistols,’ said the blind
man; ‘I’ll give the brutes what for!’</p>

<p>Slowly and heavily they carried Dwala out
across the hall, wrapped in his blankets like a
gigantic mummy; while Hartopp stood in an
expectant joy of ferocity guarding the entrance.
Down the kitchen passage they carried him, and
out into the high-walled garden—with Lady
Lillico flitting like a Banshee before them—through
the stable-yard, and into the deserted
street, where the van was waiting for them.
Public Opinion, so rigorous once in its denunciation
of ‘frontal attacks,’ seemed to have forgotten
the ‘lessons of the Boer War.’ When the big
door was battered down, and the furious crowd
broke in, half a dozen of them fell mortally
wounded before Hartopp was overpowered. The
old Fence died, fighting like a tiger for his

<p>What was Dwala thinking of as he lumbered
slowly through the length of London in that
menagerie van? Was he laughing quietly to
himself at the thought that he, the saviour of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
England, the superhuman mind, was being
hustled secretly out of England, for a trivial
pride of species, as if he had committed some
unspeakable crime? Was he weeping at the
nearness of his separation from this handful of
faithful friends? Probably not. His mind,
withdrawn to the innermost darkness of the
caves, was probably busy with the trivial
thoughts which beset men at such times. It is
only in the last moment that the soul throws
off the load of little things, and, soaring like a
bird, sees Life and Death spreading in their
vastness beneath it. He lay still, with his eyes
shut, and his temples hollow with decay. Lady
Lillico was fast asleep, under a black cloak which
somebody had thrown over her. The rest sat
silent in the jolting twilight with their feet in
the straw.</p>

<p>‘It’s a lesson for all of us,’ murmured Mr.
Cato at last.</p>

<p>‘It’s that,’ said the American; ‘it p’ints a
moral sharp enough to hurt.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As Mr. Cato stood with Joey on the jetty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
watching the last moments of departure, the
American came to the bulwarks with Lady Wyse,
and, leaning over, beckoned him.</p>

<p>‘“Skunk” was goin’ too fur for Huxtable.
I’ve just bin tellin’ Lady Wyse; he shot himself
whin the noos came. I found him lyin’ in his
room.’</p>

<p>‘Was he dead?’ murmured Mr. Cato, awestruck
at the fall of an enemy.</p>

<p>The American nodded.</p>

<p>‘Deader’n a smelt.’</p>

<p>‘I wish I were dead too!’ said Mr. Cato
bitterly.</p>

<p>The American made a motion of diving with
his joined hands. Mr. Cato shook his head.</p>

<p>‘I have my two sisters to look after.’</p>

<p>‘I wish you joy.’</p>

<p>Then the cables were loosed, the screw snorted
in the water, the American waved, and followed
Lady Wyse into the cabin; the boat slid away
from the jetty, and, slowly turning in mid-stream,
reared its defiant head towards the sea.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After many days of alert and passive silence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
Dwala died on his pallet on the deck. He
turned his face sideways down into the pillow, as
if to hide the smile that was rising to his lips;
then breathed one deep, luxurious sigh, and was
ended. They wrapped him in sacking, with an
iron reel at his feet; and in the cold, clear morning,
when the sun mounted flat and yellow to its
daily course and the low mists smoked this way
and that along the waves, they slid him without
a word off a door and over the bulwarks.</p>

<p>Down, down through the crystal indifference,
wavering gently to his appointed place in the
rocky bottom of the rapt thicket of weeds; losing
the last remnant of individuality as the motion
ceased; indistinguishable from a little heap of
sand; lying careless and obscure, like some tired
animal which has crept to rest in the wild
garden of a crumbled castle in an empty world,
long since abandoned and forgotten by mankind.</p>

<p>The ‘Phineas’ paused for a moment in mid-ocean,
the only living thing of its tribe upon the
waters without a purpose straining in its hull.
The hesitation lasted only a moment. The boat
swung round, took one look at the horizon, then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
dashed forwards again on the home journey to
England and new work.</p>

<p>England had gone back to its occupations.
The papers spoke of the return of political sanity;
of the rejection of ideas from a tainted source;
of the restoration of the system which had been
the bulwark of our greatness through so many
centuries. The composition of Lord Glendover’s
Cabinet attested his sincere intention of putting
public affairs on a business-like and efficient
footing.</p>

<p>There is no remedy for the errors of
Democracy; there is no elasticity of energy to
fulfil purposes conceived on a larger scale than
its every-day thought. Other systems may be
purged by the rising waves of national life; but
Democracy is exhaustive.</p>

<p class="ph1">RHODES SCHOLAR AT OXFORD.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<p class="ph1">PRESS OPINIONS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>TIMES.</i>—‘We never remember to have read anything which more compelled
laughter than these too-few pages. We have a perfect carnival of American slang....
The line illustrations, which are by the author, are in some cases admirable; we may
say comparable with Mr. Kipling’s.’</p>

<p><i>DAILY TELEGRAPH.</i>—‘It is one of the best bits of fooling we have read for a
long time, and is written by one who knows Oxford perfectly, and has a command of
American slang which Mark Twain himself might envy.... This little book, which is
cleverly illustrated by the author, deserves as wide a vogue as its predecessor “Verdant.”
Its humour is quite as irresistible and more subtle.’</p>

<p><i>PALL MALL GAZETTE.</i>—‘A delightful skit.... We do not think anyone
has hit off better than Mr. Calderon the extraordinary cocksureness, volubility, and
linguistic exuberance of the typical American, yet he never allows his humour to get out
of hand. The Oxford characters are marked with the same sureness of touch.’</p>

<p><i>GUARDIAN.</i>—‘If one must compare Downy with Verdant, the descendant’s
experiences are the better for being written by an Oxford man, while Verdant’s were
not. The satire is as admirable as the farce; but, on the whole, Downy as Verdant
makes one rather laugh aloud than smile.’</p>

<p><i>WORLD.</i>—‘The fun is kept up with an unflagging spirit and ingenuity that render
the skit—which the author has embellished with some diverting illustrations from his
own evidently facile pencil—a by no means unworthy comparison to “Verdant Green”
itself.’</p>

<p><i>OXFORD MAGAZINE.</i>—‘Mr. Downy V. Green is an American grandson of the
immortal Verdant, and it is not too much to say that he is fully worthy of his lineage.
From the moment one embarks upon his adventures it is difficult to lay them down.
Mr. Calderon has a biting humour, and spares neither Oxford nor America.’</p>

<p><i>MANCHESTER GUARDIAN.</i>—‘A really capital narrative, in which an accurate
knowledge of Oxford life is combined with a marvellously wide knowledge of the American
language.... Nothing is more admirable than the fertility which enables him to avoid
employing English without making his substitute for it grow tedious.’</p>

<p><i>SPECTATOR.</i>—‘Our readers may take our assurance that the book is amusing in
a high degree.’</p>

<p><i>ATHENÆUM.</i>—‘Mr. Calderon has an amazing command of picturesque slang
and metaphor from overseas, and, as befits the son of a late distinguished artist, has
himself provided excellent illustrations of his ideas.’</p>

<p><i>DAILY MAIL.</i>—‘Most excellent fooling.... His sketches possess a crude, rude
vigour that remind the faithful of the immortal pencil of Michael Angelo Titmarsh. He
has it in him to become a humorist of the first order.’</p>

<p><i>VARSITY.</i>—‘The whole book is full of rollicking humour from cover to cover.’</p>

<p><i>GLASGOW HERALD.</i>—‘The book is capitally written, and evidently from a
first-hand knowledge of student life. It is full of humour—American humour and
Oxford humour—and is altogether an excellent book of its kind.’</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class="hangingindent">
<p><b>THE BRASS BOTTLE.</b> By <span class="smcap">F. Anstey</span>, Author of
‘Vice Versâ,’ ‘The Giant’s Robe,’ ‘A Fallen Idol,’ &amp;c. With a
Frontispiece. <span class="smcap">Third Impression.</span> Crown 8vo. 6<i>s.</i></p>
</div>

<p><b>From THE SPECTATOR.</b>—‘In his logical conduct of an absurd proposition, in his
fantastic handling of the supernatural, in his brisk dialogue and effective characterisation,
Mr. Anstey has once more shown himself to be an artist and a humourist of uncommon
and enviable merit.’</p>

<p><b>From PUNCH.</b>—‘For weirdness of conception, for skilful treatment, and for abounding
humour, Mr. Anstey’s last, my Baronite avers, is a worthy companion of his first
(“Vice Versâ”).’</p>


<div class="hangingindent">
<p><b>THE TALKING HORSE and other Tales.</b>
Popular Edition. Crown 8vo. 6<i>s.</i> Cheap Edition. Crown 8vo.
limp red cloth, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>
</div>

<p><b>From THE SATURDAY REVIEW.</b>—‘A capital set of stories, thoroughly clever
and witty, often pathetic, and always humorous.’</p>

<p><b>From THE ATHENÆUM.</b>—‘The grimmest of mortals, in his most surly mood,
could hardly resist the fun of “The Talking Horse.”’</p>

<p><b>THE GIANT’S ROBE.</b> Popular Edition. Crown 8vo.
6<i>s.</i> Cheap Edition. Crown 8vo. limp red cloth, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>
</div>

<p><b>From THE PALL MALL GAZETTE.</b>—‘The main interest of the book, which is
very strong indeed, begins when Vincent returns, when Harold Caffyn discovers the secret,
when every page threatens to bring down doom on the head of the miserable Mark.
Will he confess? Will he drown himself? Will Vincent denounce him? Will Caffyn
inform on him? Will his wife abandon him?—we ask eagerly as we read and cannot
cease reading till the puzzle is solved in a series of exciting situations.’</p>

Edition. Crown 8vo. limp red cloth, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>
</div>

<p><b>From THE SATURDAY REVIEW.</b>—‘In “The Pariah” we are more than ever
struck by the sharp intuitive perception and the satirical balancing of judgment which
make the author’s writings such extremely entertaining reading. There is not a dull
page—we might say, not a dull sentence—in it....’</p>


<div class="hangingindent">
<p><b>VICE VERSÂ; or, a Lesson to Fathers.</b> Cheap
Edition. Crown 8vo. limp red cloth, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>
</div>

<p><b>From THE SATURDAY REVIEW.</b>—‘If ever there was a book made up from
beginning to end of laughter, and yet not a comic book, or a “merry” book, or a book
of jokes, or a book of pictures, or a jest book, or a tomfool book, but a perfectly sober
and serious book, in the reading of which a sober man may laugh without shame from
beginning to end, it is the book called “Vice Versâ; or, a Lesson to Fathers.”...
We close the book, recommending it very earnestly to all fathers in the first instance,
and their sons, nephews, uncles, and male cousins next.’</p>

</div>

<p><b>From THE TIMES.</b>—‘Will delight the multitudinous public that laughed over
“Vice Versâ.”... The boy who brings the accursed image to Champion’s house,
Mr. Bales, the artist’s factotum, and above all Mr. Yarker, the ex-butler who has turned
policeman, are figures whom it is as pleasant to meet as it is impossible to forget.’</p>

for many a day.’</p>
